The duo emphasized how this particular track shines through as a cultural touchstone, representing Bhosle’s ability to stay ahead of her time. “It’s not just a song,” Rhythm adds, “it’s a movement, a revolution that Asha Bhosle ji brought to life with her voice. Her work continues to inspire and stand as a beacon for innovation.\n",
      "What makes this tribute even more special is the bond that Asha Bhosle shares with the duo. Rachana Shah, being her niece, has always had a personal connection with Asha Bhosle’s journey. Together, Rachana and Rhythm have not only celebrated the legacy of legends like Asha Bhosle but have also curated narratives that bridge the gap between the golden era of Indian music and the present.\n",
      "The partnership of RachanaRhythm is known for their work on capturing the spirit of legendary artists like Lata Mangeshkar, Kishori Amonkar, Girija Devi, and Usha Mangeshkar, amongst others. Their ability to weave together personal stories and historical milestones has earned them acclaim in the literary and cultural spheres.\n",
      "In this tribute to Asha Bhosle, they showcase once again how her presence has not only transformed music but also shaped cultural movements. Their words remind us that Bhosle’s genius is immeasurable, continuing to inspire new generations with her unmatched versatility and ever-youthful persona.\n",
      "As RachanaRhythm puts it so eloquently: “Asha Bhosle belongs to every generation.” This statement resonates deeply because Asha Bhosle’s music is not confined to any era; it spans across ages, genres, and emotions. From her unforgettable contributions to Indian cinema music to her experimental works that embraced world music, Asha Bhosle remains a force to be reckoned with.\n",
      "This latest tribute from RachanaRhythm reinforces the idea that while trends in music may come and go, legends like Asha Bhosle are forever. Her voice is a reminder of an era gone by, yet it continues to remain fresh, relevant, and cherished by listeners young and old.\n",
      "In their touching tribute, RachanaRhythm exemplifies how Asha Bhosle’s brilliance remains an indelible part of the musical landscape. Their words echo a sentiment that rings true for all who have experienced the magic of her voice—Asha Bhosle’s genius is beyond measure, and her youthful spirit continues to inspire the world.\n",

      "In a worrying cyber attack, the official Twitter account of the Indian Premier League (IPL) team Delhi Capitals (DC) was hacked on Wednesday, September 18, 2024. The breach occurred on the alleged “national hacking day,” which has become notorious for increased cyber activity across various platforms. Fortunately, the incident was contained swiftly as the suspicious post was deleted within minutes by the franchise.\n",
      "The hacker posted a malicious link on DC’s account, which was believed to be part of a larger scam targeting users of the Raydium decentralized exchange platform. Such fraudulent links are typically designed to lead unsuspecting users to fake websites that steal personal data or cryptocurrency.\n",
      "Interestingly, former Arsenal footballer Alexandre Lacazette’s Twitter account was also compromised on the same day, sharing similar content. This highlights the vulnerability of even well-established social media accounts to sophisticated cyber attacks, where hackers exploit popular profiles to execute phishing scams.\n",
      "DC’s Performance in IPL 2024\n",
      "On the cricketing front, Delhi Capitals finished the IPL 2024 season in sixth place with 14 points, narrowly missing out on the playoffs. Under the leadership of Rishabh Pant, who returned to competitive cricket after a 15-month injury layoff, the team managed to win seven out of 14 matches in the league stage.\n",
      "Despite Pant’s remarkable return, which saw him finish as DC’s top scorer for the season, the team once again fell short of reaching the knockout stages. The Delhi-based franchise, which has participated in all 17 editions of the IPL, continues its quest for a maiden title. Their best performance remains the 2020 IPL, where they reached the final under Shreyas Iyer’s captaincy but were defeated.\n",
      "Delhi Capitals’ Title Drought\n",
      "The IPL 2020 final appearance in the UAE was a historic moment for the franchise, as it was the first time they had made it to the tournament’s summit clash. However, DC’s elusive hunt for their first IPL title continues, and they remain one of the three teams in the league to have participated in all editions of the tournament without lifting the trophy.\n",

The Indian team management announced a 15-member squad for the two-Test series against Bangladesh, starting September 19 in Chennai.\n",
      "The Indian team selected three wicketkeeper-batters in the form of Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul making comebacks to the Test set-up while Dhruv Jurel retained his place. The Mumbai-based batter Sarfaraz Khan, who had a great debut Test series against England earlier in the year, was retained in the squad. As per reports, KL Rahul will play ahead of Sarfaraz at the number 5 position in the first Test.\n",

      "\"Honestly, I feel bad for Sarfaraz Khan. But, this happens, at times, in Test cricket. You would have been playing well but when a big player returns, you will have to lose your place. Take for instance, Rishabh Pant is returning because of which Dhruv Jurel and Sarfaraz Khan are losing their places. KL Rahul is coming in.\n",
      "\"At the back of the mind, they are also keeping the Australia series. New Zealand are also coming. KL Rahul has performed well overseas, in Australia he has done well,\" Srikkanth said.\n",

The match, initially expected to commence without hitches, now faces uncertainty as teams and fans alike eagerly await the possibility of play on Day 3.

The sky is expected to remain clear for the remainder of Tuesday, with no significant rainfall predicted, which could potentially allow the toss to take place and the game to start. However, the forecast for Wednesday suggests a 1 mm thunderstorm in the afternoon, which could pose a risk to the proceedings if the weather conditions worsen. Given the current situation, even a brief spell of rain could further damage the already compromised pitch.\n",
      "Pitch Report: Current Conditions and Challenges\n",
      "The Greater Noida Sports Complex ground has been battling adverse weather conditions, with continuous rain over the past week. The pitch, which had been under preparation for this Test match, has not been able to recover from the wet conditions. The ground staff have struggled to clear wet patches, making the playing surface potentially hazardous for players. The venue's inadequate drainage system has exacerbated the problem, leaving the ground in a less-than-ideal state for cricket.\n",
      "The pitch report highlights that the drainage issues, combined with the persistent rain, have rendered the outfield and pitch unsuitable for play. Earlier reports indicated that the venue's drainage system was unable to handle the volume of water, leading to a soggy outfield and flooded practice pitches. This has not only disrupted the Test match but also impacted both teams' preparation.\n",
      "Impact on Teams: Afghanistan and New Zealand\n",
      "For Afghanistan, the weather has been particularly frustrating. Their one-week training camp was severely hampered by the rain, limiting them to just one three-day game instead of the planned two. The team had hoped to utilize these practice sessions to fine-tune their preparations for this crucial Test series. The repeated delays and the poor state of the pitch have disrupted their momentum and could affect their performance once the game does commence.\n",
      "On the other hand, New Zealand also faced challenges with their preparation. Their practice sessions were washed out, and routine fielding drills were canceled due to the damp conditions. The lack of adequate preparation could impact their readiness for the match, adding another layer of uncertainty to the contest.\n",

His recent struggles have been a topic of widespread discussion, and fans were hopeful he would use this opportunity to regain his form. Unfortunately, Babar's performance did not meet these expectations.\n",
      "In the match, Babar was dismissed for just 20 runs, falling prey to a spinner's delivery from Mohammad Asghar. His attempt to play a sweeping shot, a risky move that ultimately failed, resulted in his dismissal. This failure continues a troubling trend for Babar, who has struggled for consistency in recent months.\n",
      "Shan Masood's Resilient Innings\n",
      "While Babar’s performance was underwhelming, Shan Masood provided a glimmer of hope for the Stallions. The Pakistan Test captain demonstrated resilience and skill, scoring a solid 90 runs from 80 balls before being caught out. Masood’s innings was marked by a disciplined approach and effective shot selection, contrasting sharply with Babar's struggles.\n",
      "Masood’s performance is a positive sign as the Champions One-Day Cup approaches. His ability to anchor the innings and score runs under pressure will be crucial for his team’s success in the tournament.\n",
      "The Broader Context of Babar’s Struggles\n",
      "Babar Azam's recent form has been a significant concern. His performance in the Test series against Bangladesh was notably poor, including a duck in the series opener and modest scores in subsequent innings. This ongoing struggle has seen him slip in international rankings and has attracted criticism from fans and experts alike.\n",
      "The practice match performance has added to the scrutiny, with social media reactions highlighting fans’ frustration. Babar’s tendency to be dismissed by spinners and his recent lack of big scores have only intensified the debate about his current form and his role in the upcoming Test series against England.\n",

As stated by an ACB official, \"We chose Noida because it's closer to Delhi and connectivity from Kabul is better.\" This pragmatic approach, however, has been overshadowed by mounting criticism and logistical issues at the Shahid Vijay Pathik Sports Complex.\n",
      "Logistical Challenges and Criticism\n",
      "The Shahid Vijay Pathik Sports Complex has faced severe criticism due to its inability to host play on consecutive days. On the second day of the Test, wet patches on the ground, despite clear weather, forced another day of cancellations. This situation has raised concerns about the venue’s preparedness and overall management.\n",
      "Sources close to the matter have suggested that the decision to use this venue was financially motivated. Allegations have emerged that both the ACB and the Greater Noida authority were keen on capitalizing on the event to generate revenue, even though they were aware of the potential weather-related challenges. \"This stadium comes under the Greater Noida Authority. Some of its people and some people from Afghanistan Cricket organised a match in Greater Noida during the rainy season to make money,\" claimed a source.\n",
      "BCCI’s Offers and ACB’s Decision\n",
      "The BCCI’s offers of Kanpur and Bengaluru were reportedly turned down due to logistical preferences. The BCCI, known for its infrastructure and experience in handling large-scale cricketing events, was ready to provide the necessary support for a smooth experience. UPCA, in particular, offered their assistance to ensure that the venue was up to standard, yet these offers were declined.\n",
      "The Groundstaff Efforts\n",
      "Despite the criticism, the groundstaff in Noida have been working diligently to get the venue match-ready.

      "While Kohli and Smith are often pitted against each other as two of the modern game's greats, their rivalry is underpinned by mutual respect. Smith, who has accumulated 9,685 runs in 109 Tests at an impressive average of 56.97, acknowledges Kohli's contributions to the sport. Kohli, with 8,848 runs in 113 Tests at an average of 49.15, has been a formidable opponent, particularly in Australian conditions where he has excelled.\n",
      "Their individual records are a testament to their prowess: Kohli has amassed 2,042 runs in 25 Tests against Australia, while Smith is the ninth-highest run-getter in Border-Gavaskar Trophy history with 1,887 runs. These statistics underscore their significant impact on this iconic series.\n",
      "Memorable Moments\n",
      "One of the most poignant moments in their rivalry came during the 2019 World Cup when Kohli publicly defended Smith from crowd boos related to the 'Sandpaper Gate' scandal. Smith's gratitude for this gesture exemplifies the respect they hold for each other, despite their fierce competition.\n",
      "Series Highlights\n",
      "As the Border-Gavaskar Trophy unfolds, the series will feature several key fixtures that promise to captivate fans. The second Test, scheduled for December 6-10 at the Adelaide Oval, will showcase a day-night format under the stadium's lights. The series will then shift to The Gabba in Brisbane for the third Test from December 14-18, followed by the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne's iconic MCG. The final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground from January 3-7 will serve as the climax to what is expected to be an exhilarating series.\n",

      " Babar Azam's Wardrobe Malfunction: Pakistan Captain Wraps Towel After Misplacing Trousers During Training\n",
      "Babar Azam is no stranger to the limelight, both for his masterful cricketing skills and the weight of expectations that accompany being Pakistan’s star batsman. However, as he navigates a rare lean patch, even the smallest missteps are magnified. In a recent training session, a lighthearted yet viral moment highlighted the human side of this cricketing sensation: a wardrobe mishap that saw Babar Azam wrap a towel around his waist, humorously salvaging the situation before prayers with his teammates.\n",

      "This amusing episode is perhaps a welcome distraction from the ongoing scrutiny around his recent performances and leadership. But beyond the laughs, Babar’s determination to remain grounded and focused on his duties, no matter the circumstance, resonates with fans and underscores the immense pressure he shoulders as Pakistan's cricket captain.\n",
      "A Humorous Towel Moment Goes Viral\n",
      "During a training session leading up to an important series, Babar Azam, dressed in shorts, was seen frantically searching for his trousers. As the prayer time approached and his teammates lined up, Babar couldn’t locate them in time. Ever resourceful, he quickly wrapped a towel around his waist and joined his teammates for prayers.\n",
      "The moment didn’t go unnoticed. Fans in the stadium erupted in cheers, embracing the lightheartedness of the situation. Instantly, photos and videos of Babar’s impromptu towel attire went viral, offering a rare glimpse into a relatable, off-field moment that humanized one of cricket’s greats. The crowd’s positive response reminded everyone that even under intense scrutiny, Babar remains beloved by fans for his humility and sense of humor.\n",
      "The Captaincy Conundrum: Is Babar Safe?\n",
      "Beyond the lighthearted viral incident, Babar Azam’s captaincy has been a hot topic since Pakistan's premature exit from the 2023 ODI World Cup. Criticism mounted as Pakistan, led by Babar, failed to progress past the round-robin stage. This led to him being replaced as the white-ball captain by Shaheen Shah Afridi. However, after a single disappointing series, Shaheen, too, faced pressure, raising questions about the leadership dynamics within the team.\n",
      "In the Test format, a similar fate befell Babar. After stepping down from captaincy, he was replaced by Shan Masood, but Pakistan’s 0-2 Test series defeat to Bangladesh reignited the debate over leadership stability. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), however, has been quick to dismiss rumors of further captaincy changes.\n",
      "According to an insider from the PCB, \"There has been no discussion on changing the captains. Both coaches, Gary Kirsten and Jason Gillespie, have made it clear they want to give both Shan and Babar a fair run to prove their leadership capabilities.\"\n",
      "The statement reflects a commitment to consistency, a stark contrast to the revolving door of captains that Pakistan has seen in recent times. The PCB’s focus seems to be on fostering long-term leadership rather than making knee-jerk decisions after a few bad results.\n",
      "Looking Ahead: Babar’s Test as Captain\n",
      "Despite the media speculation and the growing noise around Babar’s form and leadership, the PCB has made it clear that Babar remains at the helm for the time being. With a challenging series against England on the horizon, followed by a limited-overs tour to Australia, Babar will be keen to prove his critics wrong, both as a batsman and as a captain.\n",
      "His recent struggles with form are well-documented, but Babar Azam’s ability to bounce back has never been in question. Whether it’s on the field or managing unexpected situations off it—like his towel-wrapped prayer moment—Babar has shown resilience and a calm demeanor under pressure.\n",
      "Fan Support Remains Strong\n",
      "While the media and pundits may have their doubts, Babar Azam continues to enjoy immense support from the public. A recent poll, conducted after the wardrobe mishap, asked fans how they felt about the incident. The overwhelming majority found the moment “funny and relatable,” showcasing the enduring goodwill Babar has built over the years.\n",
      "For Pakistan cricket fans, Babar’s ability to handle adversity with grace—whether it’s losing his trousers or navigating a difficult period in his career—is a testament to his strength of character. It’s a quality that has seen him rise to the top of world cricket, and one that will undoubtedly serve him well in the tests that lie ahead.\n",

      "The Indian sports community was rocked by a recent controversy involving Vinesh Phogat and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President PT Usha. The drama unfolded after Phogat, who had been one of India's brightest medal prospects, faced disqualification from the women's 50kg wrestling final at the Paris Olympics. The disqualification, due to exceeding the weight limit by a mere 100 grams, marked a heartbreaking end to her Olympic journey. However, the situation took a darker turn when Phogat accused PT Usha of exploiting her vulnerability for political gain.\n",

      "The Disqualification and Its Aftermath\n",
      "Vinesh Phogat, the first female wrestler from India to reach an Olympic final, had her hopes dashed when she was found overweight and subsequently disqualified. Despite desperate attempts to make weight—including drastic measures like cutting off her hair and enduring sleepless nights—Phogat's efforts were in vain. According to the regulations set by United World Wrestling, all of her previous results were rendered null and void, leaving her without a medal.\n",
      "Following her disqualification, Phogat was taken to a medical facility within the Paris Games village. It was here that PT Usha, who had earlier expressed solidarity with the wrestler, met her. A photograph of this encounter, shared on social media, quickly went viral. However, the image, intended to demonstrate support, became a source of controversy.\n",
      "Phogat's Accusations Against PT Usha\n",
      "In a recent statement, Vinesh Phogat voiced her dissatisfaction with the IOA chief's actions. She alleged that PT Usha had taken a photo with her on the hospital bed without her consent. Phogat criticized the gesture, stating, “You are on a hospital bed, where you don't know what's happening in life outside, you are going through one of the worst phases of your life. At that place, just to show everyone you are standing with me you clicked a photo without telling me and then putting it on social media to say you are standing with me). That's not how you show support. What was it more than (posturing)!” Her comments reflect a deep sense of betrayal and frustration, as she felt the gesture was more about public relations than genuine support.\n",
      "Phogat expressed further disappointment, suggesting that political maneuvering had influenced the situation. “I don't know what support I got there. PT Usha madam visited me at the hospital. One photo was clicked... Like you said, in politics a lot happens behind closed doors. Similarly, politics happened there (in Paris) as well. That's why I was heartbroken. Otherwise a lot of people are saying 'don't leave wrestling'. For what should I continue! There is politics everywhere,” she lamented.\n",
      "Phogat's Political Shift\n",
      "The aftermath of the scandal saw Vinesh Phogat making a dramatic shift in her career. Just a day after the disqualification, she announced her retirement from wrestling. The situation worsened when her appeal for a joint silver medal, filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), was rejected. In a bid to redefine her public image and continue serving the community, Phogat returned to India and joined the Indian National Congress, marking her entry into politics.\n",

It was Sanjay, hovering on the right side of the circle, to lob in a cross pass that was swiftly deflected by Sukhjeet.

With a 3-0 lead on the board, India was in a comfortable position while Japan tried to shake off the early nerves and bounce back in the game. They made quick amends in their attack to fetch a PC in the 21st minute. But Japan's drag flick was finely blocked by Indian rushers, enabling their team to launch a quick counterattack.\n",

      " Government Monitoring Airfare For Any Exorbitant Hike During Festivals: Aviation Minister\n",
      "Airfare: Union Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu said on Monday that his ministry is monitoring airfares daily and asking air operators not to exploit passengers during festival season when demand tends to escalate.\n",
      "\"We are continuously talking to airline operators and have asked them not to exploit the opportunity, and keep airfares reasonable. We from the ministry are doing whatever is needed,\" Naidu told reporters on the sidelines of an event focused on regional air connectivity.\n",
      "Asked if there are any guidelines for airline operators regarding the cap on airfare, the minister apprised that airfare is a market-driven process and hence a cap could not be imposed on it.\n",
      "Tariff fixation has been deregulated and airlines are free to fix reasonable tariffs. \"So far, we haven't noticed any unreasonable spike in airfares. They are cooperating with us. If we notice any unforeseen price rise, we will do whatever is needed to be done,\" the minister said.\n",
      "The minister said ever since he took charge of the ministry, his commitment as a minister has been to keep airfares affordable. During the recent Parliament session, the Civil Aviation Minister took many questions related to the exorbitant rise in airfares, delays in flights, and aviation-related infrastructure in the country.\n",
      "He had apprised the Parliament about the aircraft that are currently grounded due to engine issues, which he said caused an additional burden to the overall fleet.\n",
      "\"There are 800 odd planes in the country. And because of the (some) engine issue, almost 120 planes are grounded, and they are not able to fly. Because of the lack of the aircraft that we have in our fleet, there is a lot of additional burden on the existing aircraft - which is also driving up the prices,\" he had asserted.\n",
      "\"One happy thing all must know, we have 1200 aircraft on order, the highest in the world. We are ensuring that they are coming on time, they are delivered on time. We are ensuring from the ministry whatever best we can do,\" he had said.\n",

      " IndiGo Introduces RNP AR Approach For Kathmandu Flights To Help Improve Precision, Efficiency\n",
      "IndiGo on Wednesday said it has introduced a flight procedure that will enable pilots to navigate the complex terrain surrounding Kathmandu valley with more precision. Aviation regulator DGCA validated the IndiGo flight operated with A320 plane that utilised the Required Navigation Performance with Authorisation Required (RNP AR) approach.\n",
      "\"RNP AR technology is specifically engineered for airports situated in geographically challenging and high-altitude regions, such as Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport (KTM),\" IndiGo said in a release.\n",
      "\"With the airport surrounded by the Himalayas, landing in Kathmandu has traditionally been a challenge for pilots, particularly during adverse weather conditions,\" IndiGo said.\n",
      "According to the carrier, the implementation of the RNP AR system will enable aircraft to adhere to predetermined flight paths with remarkable accuracy, effectively mitigating the risks posed by the mountainous landscape.\n",
      "The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said the RNP AR approach offers several advantages, including enhanced safety through greater precision accuracy and a more stabilised approach.\n",
      "It reduces operational inefficiencies, such as the need for multiple step-downs in non-precision approaches, and lowers the landing minima, the regulator added.\n",
      "Also, the approach will help in having lower fuel burn, reduced carbon footprint as well as financial savings through minimised crew and flight time losses.\n",
      "For RNP AR approaches, pilots have to undergo specialised simulator training and the aircraft must be properly equipped and capable of executing this advanced approach.\n",
      "\"An all women inspectors team from DGCA and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal were on board to oversee the validation flight,\" DGCA said in a separate release.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the ever-evolving world of Indian music, few legends have managed to transcend generations like Asha Bhosle. Known for her unparalleled versatility, youthful spirit, and boundless energy, Asha Bhosle has cemented her place not just in the hearts of those who grew up listening to her, but also in the souls of younger audiences who continue to discover her magic. This eternal appeal is captured beautifully in a special tribute by the celebrated duo RachanaRhythm, comprising writer Rachana Shah and renowned author Rhythm Wagholikar.\n",
      "Together, Rachana and Rhythm, who are family to Asha Bhosle are known for their deep association with Indian cultural icons, recently penned a heartfelt message for Asha Bhosle, celebrating her brilliance and ongoing influence. Their message reads:\n",
      "“Your exuberance is so contagious, that it has transcended generations and each generation says, ‘Asha Bhosle belongs to us!’ Yes, you belong to all of us! It’s because you remain youthful; we remain so. How do we quantify your genius? We cannot.”\n",
      "This quote from RachanaRhythm not only reflects their admiration but also encapsulates the sentiment of millions of fans who see Asha Bhosle as a beacon of timeless charm. Her ability to remain youthful, despite decades of reigning as one of India’s most iconic voices, is precisely what makes her a global cultural treasure. Rachana Shah is Asha Bhosles niece.\n",
      "As part of their tribute, RachanaRhythm shared one of Asha Bhosle’s iconic and revolutionary songs—Dum Maro Dum, a cult classic that stands as a hallmark of the 1970s psychedelic era and flower power movement. The duo emphasized how this particular track shines through as a cultural touchstone, representing Bhosle’s ability to stay ahead of her time. “It’s not just a song,” Rhythm adds, “it’s a movement, a revolution that Asha Bhosle ji brought to life with her voice. Her work continues to inspire and stand as a beacon for innovation.\n",
      "What makes this tribute even more special is the bond that Asha Bhosle shares with the duo. Rachana Shah, being her niece, has always had a personal connection with Asha Bhosle’s journey. Together, Rachana and Rhythm have not only celebrated the legacy of legends like Asha Bhosle but have also curated narratives that bridge the gap between the golden era of Indian music and the present.\n",
      "The partnership of RachanaRhythm is known for their work on capturing the spirit of legendary artists like Lata Mangeshkar, Kishori Amonkar, Girija Devi, and Usha Mangeshkar, amongst others. Their ability to weave together personal stories and historical milestones has earned them acclaim in the literary and cultural spheres.\n",
      "In this tribute to Asha Bhosle, they showcase once again how her presence has not only transformed music but also shaped cultural movements. Their words remind us that Bhosle’s genius is immeasurable, continuing to inspire new generations with her unmatched versatility and ever-youthful persona.\n",
      "As RachanaRhythm puts it so eloquently: “Asha Bhosle belongs to every generation.” This statement resonates deeply because Asha Bhosle’s music is not confined to any era; it spans across ages, genres, and emotions. From her unforgettable contributions to Indian cinema music to her experimental works that embraced world music, Asha Bhosle remains a force to be reckoned with.\n",
      "This latest tribute from RachanaRhythm reinforces the idea that while trends in music may come and go, legends like Asha Bhosle are forever. Her voice is a reminder of an era gone by, yet it continues to remain fresh, relevant, and cherished by listeners young and old.\n",
      "In their touching tribute, RachanaRhythm exemplifies how Asha Bhosle’s brilliance remains an indelible part of the musical landscape. Their words echo a sentiment that rings true for all who have experienced the magic of her voice—Asha Bhosle’s genius is beyond measure, and her youthful spirit continues to inspire the world. \n",

      "\n",
      "In a worrying cyber attack, the official Twitter account of the Indian Premier League (IPL) team Delhi Capitals (DC) was hacked on Wednesday, September 18, 2024. The breach occurred on the alleged “national hacking day,” which has become notorious for increased cyber activity across various platforms. Fortunately, the incident was contained swiftly as the suspicious post was deleted within minutes by the franchise.\n",
      "The hacker posted a malicious link on DC’s account, which was believed to be part of a larger scam targeting users of the Raydium decentralized exchange platform. Such fraudulent links are typically designed to lead unsuspecting users to fake websites that steal personal data or cryptocurrency.\n",
      "Interestingly, former Arsenal footballer Alexandre Lacazette’s Twitter account was also compromised on the same day, sharing similar content. This highlights the vulnerability of even well-established social media accounts to sophisticated cyber attacks, where hackers exploit popular profiles to execute phishing scams.\n",
      "DC’s Performance in IPL 2024\n",
      "On the cricketing front, Delhi Capitals finished the IPL 2024 season in sixth place with 14 points, narrowly missing out on the playoffs. Under the leadership of Rishabh Pant, who returned to competitive cricket after a 15-month injury layoff, the team managed to win seven out of 14 matches in the league stage.\n",
      "Despite Pant’s remarkable return, which saw him finish as DC’s top scorer for the season, the team once again fell short of reaching the knockout stages. The Delhi-based franchise, which has participated in all 17 editions of the IPL, continues its quest for a maiden title. Their best performance remains the 2020 IPL, where they reached the final under Shreyas Iyer’s captaincy but were defeated.\n",
      "Delhi Capitals’ Title Drought\n",
      "The IPL 2020 final appearance in the UAE was a historic moment for the franchise, as it was the first time they had made it to the tournament’s summit clash. However, DC’s elusive hunt for their first IPL title continues, and they remain one of the three teams in the league to have participated in all editions of the tournament without lifting the trophy.\n",
      "As the Delhi Capitals look ahead to the next season, they will aim to strengthen their squad and break their title drought, while also ensuring their digital security is up to par to avoid further cyber incidents. \n",

      "\n",
      "Former India cricketer Kris Srikkanth came up with a blunt remark, saying that the Indian selectors’ decision to add KL Rahul for the Test series against Bangladesh was right. The Indian team management announced a 15-member squad for the two-Test series against Bangladesh, starting September 19 in Chennai.\n",
      "The Indian team selected three wicketkeeper-batters in the form of Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul making comebacks to the Test set-up while Dhruv Jurel retained his place. The Mumbai-based batter Sarfaraz Khan, who had a great debut Test series against England earlier in the year, was retained in the squad. As per reports, KL Rahul will play ahead of Sarfaraz at the number 5 position in the first Test.\n",
      "While talking on a YouTube show, Srikkanth supported the idea of bringing in KL Rahul ahead of Sarfaraz Khan.\n",
      "\"Honestly, I feel bad for Sarfaraz Khan. But, this happens, at times, in Test cricket. You would have been playing well but when a big player returns, you will have to lose your place. Take for instance, Rishabh Pant is returning because of which Dhruv Jurel and Sarfaraz Khan are losing their places. KL Rahul is coming in.\n",
      "\"At the back of the mind, they are also keeping the Australia series. New Zealand are also coming. KL Rahul has performed well overseas, in Australia he has done well,\" Srikkanth said.\n",
      "Rahul was in good touch in the first Test of a five-match series against England earlier this year as he smashed 86 and 22, standing like a wall in India's defeat in Hyderabad. \n",

I'm not surprised that he's back in the side, and he will continue to play for India in Tests,\" said Ganguly. \"He will be an all-time great in Tests if he keeps performing like this. For me, he needs to get better in the shorter formats. With the talent he has, I'm sure with time, he will become one of the best.\"\n",
      "Pant’s Test credentials have never been in doubt, with his ability to counter-attack in difficult situations making him an invaluable asset for India.

      "\n",
      "The highly anticipated Test match between Afghanistan and New Zealand at the Greater Noida Sports Complex has been marred by weather-related disruptions, with the first two days washed out due to incessant rain and a persistently wet outfield. The match, initially expected to commence without hitches, now faces uncertainty as teams and fans alike eagerly await the possibility of play on Day 3. The weather forecast for the coming days and the state of the pitch will be pivotal in determining whether the match will proceed as planned.\n",

      "Weather Forecast: Day 3 Expectations\n",
      "According to Accuweather.com, the weather forecast for Day 3, September 11, 2024, offers a glimmer of hope for cricket enthusiasts. The sky is expected to remain clear for the remainder of Tuesday, with no significant rainfall predicted, which could potentially allow the toss to take place and the game to start. However, the forecast for Wednesday suggests a 1 mm thunderstorm in the afternoon, which could pose a risk to the proceedings if the weather conditions worsen. Given the current situation, even a brief spell of rain could further damage the already compromised pitch.\n",
      "Pitch Report: Current Conditions and Challenges\n",
      "The Greater Noida Sports Complex ground has been battling adverse weather conditions, with continuous rain over the past week. The pitch, which had been under preparation for this Test match, has not been able to recover from the wet conditions. The ground staff have struggled to clear wet patches, making the playing surface potentially hazardous for players. The venue's inadequate drainage system has exacerbated the problem, leaving the ground in a less-than-ideal state for cricket.\n",
      "The pitch report highlights that the drainage issues, combined with the persistent rain, have rendered the outfield and pitch unsuitable for play. Earlier reports indicated that the venue's drainage system was unable to handle the volume of water, leading to a soggy outfield and flooded practice pitches. This has not only disrupted the Test match but also impacted both teams' preparation.\n",
      "Impact on Teams: Afghanistan and New Zealand\n",
      "For Afghanistan, the weather has been particularly frustrating. Their one-week training camp was severely hampered by the rain, limiting them to just one three-day game instead of the planned two. The team had hoped to utilize these practice sessions to fine-tune their preparations for this crucial Test series. The repeated delays and the poor state of the pitch have disrupted their momentum and could affect their performance once the game does commence.\n",
      "On the other hand, New Zealand also faced challenges with their preparation. Their practice sessions were washed out, and routine fielding drills were canceled due to the damp conditions. The lack of adequate preparation could impact their readiness for the match, adding another layer of uncertainty to the contest.\n",
      "Venue Controversy: ACB’s Perspective\n",
      "The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) has expressed dissatisfaction with the venue, highlighting the state of the facilities at the Greater Noida Sports Complex. An ACB official, speaking to The Indian Express, mentioned that the stadia in Afghanistan have better facilities compared to this venue. The lack of proper infrastructure and the rejection of alternative venues such as Lucknow and Dehradun, due to their T20 league commitments, have left the ACB with limited options. \n",

      "Babar Azam, Pakistan’s white-ball captain and a leading figure in the cricketing world, entered the practice match with high expectations. His recent struggles have been a topic of widespread discussion, and fans were hopeful he would use this opportunity to regain his form. Unfortunately, Babar's performance did not meet these expectations.\n",
      "In the match, Babar was dismissed for just 20 runs, falling prey to a spinner's delivery from Mohammad Asghar. His attempt to play a sweeping shot, a risky move that ultimately failed, resulted in his dismissal. This failure continues a troubling trend for Babar, who has struggled for consistency in recent months.\n",
      "Shan Masood's Resilient Innings\n",
      "While Babar’s performance was underwhelming, Shan Masood provided a glimmer of hope for the Stallions. The Pakistan Test captain demonstrated resilience and skill, scoring a solid 90 runs from 80 balls before being caught out. Masood’s innings was marked by a disciplined approach and effective shot selection, contrasting sharply with Babar's struggles.\n",
      "Masood’s performance is a positive sign as the Champions One-Day Cup approaches. His ability to anchor the innings and score runs under pressure will be crucial for his team’s success in the tournament.\n",
      "The Broader Context of Babar’s Struggles\n",
      "Babar Azam's recent form has been a significant concern. His performance in the Test series against Bangladesh was notably poor, including a duck in the series opener and modest scores in subsequent innings. This ongoing struggle has seen him slip in international rankings and has attracted criticism from fans and experts alike.\n",
      "The practice match performance has added to the scrutiny, with social media reactions highlighting fans’ frustration. Babar’s tendency to be dismissed by spinners and his recent lack of big scores have only intensified the debate about his current form and his role in the upcoming Test series against England.\n",
      "Champions One-Day Cup: An Important Prelude\n",
      "The Champions One-Day Cup, commencing on September 12 at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad, represents a crucial phase for Pakistan’s cricketers. For Babar Azam, the tournament is an opportunity to turn his fortunes around and build confidence ahead of the Test series. Conversely, Shan Masood’s strong showing in the practice match could be a significant boost for his team. \n",

As stated by an ACB official, \"We chose Noida because it's closer to Delhi and connectivity from Kabul is better.\" This pragmatic approach, however, has been overshadowed by mounting criticism and logistical issues at the Shahid Vijay Pathik Sports Complex.\n",
      "Logistical Challenges and Criticism\n",
      "The Shahid Vijay Pathik Sports Complex has faced severe criticism due to its inability to host play on consecutive days. On the second day of the Test, wet patches on the ground, despite clear weather, forced another day of cancellations. This situation has raised concerns about the venue’s preparedness and overall management.\n",
      "Sources close to the matter have suggested that the decision to use this venue was financially motivated. Allegations have emerged that both the ACB and the Greater Noida authority were keen on capitalizing on the event to generate revenue, even though they were aware of the potential weather-related challenges. \"This stadium comes under the Greater Noida Authority. Some of its people and some people from Afghanistan Cricket organised a match in Greater Noida during the rainy season to make money,\" claimed a source.\n",
      "BCCI’s Offers and ACB’s Decision\n",
      "The BCCI’s offers of Kanpur and Bengaluru were reportedly turned down due to logistical preferences. The BCCI, known for its infrastructure and experience in handling large-scale cricketing events, was ready to provide the necessary support for a smooth experience. UPCA, in particular, offered their assistance to ensure that the venue was up to standard, yet these offers were declined.\n",

      "In a recent interview with Star Sports, Steve Smith opened up about his relationship with Indian batting maestro Virat Kohli. Smith, known for his meticulous technique and competitive spirit, highlighted the camaraderie he shares with Kohli. The two cricketers, who often exchange messages, have developed a mutual respect that transcends their on-field rivalry.\n",

Kohli, with 8,848 runs in 113 Tests at an average of 49.15, has been a formidable opponent, particularly in Australian conditions where he has excelled.\n",

      "Babar Azam's Wardrobe Malfunction: Pakistan Captain Wraps Towel After Misplacing Trousers During Training \n",
      "\n",
      "Babar Azam is no stranger to the limelight, both for his masterful cricketing skills and the weight of expectations that accompany being Pakistan’s star batsman. However, as he navigates a rare lean patch, even the smallest missteps are magnified. In a recent training session, a lighthearted yet viral moment highlighted the human side of this cricketing sensation: a wardrobe mishap that saw Babar Azam wrap a towel around his waist, humorously salvaging the situation before prayers with his teammates.\n",

      "This amusing episode is perhaps a welcome distraction from the ongoing scrutiny around his recent performances and leadership. But beyond the laughs, Babar’s determination to remain grounded and focused on his duties, no matter the circumstance, resonates with fans and underscores the immense pressure he shoulders as Pakistan's cricket captain.\n",
      "A Humorous Towel Moment Goes Viral\n",
      "During a training session leading up to an important series, Babar Azam, dressed in shorts, was seen frantically searching for his trousers. As the prayer time approached and his teammates lined up, Babar couldn’t locate them in time. Ever resourceful, he quickly wrapped a towel around his waist and joined his teammates for prayers.\n",
      "The moment didn’t go unnoticed. Fans in the stadium erupted in cheers, embracing the lightheartedness of the situation. Instantly, photos and videos of Babar’s impromptu towel attire went viral, offering a rare glimpse into a relatable, off-field moment that humanized one of cricket’s greats. The crowd’s positive response reminded everyone that even under intense scrutiny, Babar remains beloved by fans for his humility and sense of humor.\n",
      "The Captaincy Conundrum: Is Babar Safe?\n",
      "Beyond the lighthearted viral incident, Babar Azam’s captaincy has been a hot topic since Pakistan's premature exit from the 2023 ODI World Cup. Criticism mounted as Pakistan, led by Babar, failed to progress past the round-robin stage. This led to him being replaced as the white-ball captain by Shaheen Shah Afridi. However, after a single disappointing series, Shaheen, too, faced pressure, raising questions about the leadership dynamics within the team.\n",
      "In the Test format, a similar fate befell Babar. After stepping down from captaincy, he was replaced by Shan Masood, but Pakistan’s 0-2 Test series defeat to Bangladesh reignited the debate over leadership stability. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), however, has been quick to dismiss rumors of further captaincy changes.\n",
      "According to an insider from the PCB, \"There has been no discussion on changing the captains. Both coaches, Gary Kirsten and Jason Gillespie, have made it clear they want to give both Shan and Babar a fair run to prove their leadership capabilities.\"\n",
      "The statement reflects a commitment to consistency, a stark contrast to the revolving door of captains that Pakistan has seen in recent times. The PCB’s focus seems to be on fostering long-term leadership rather than making knee-jerk decisions after a few bad results.\n",
      "Looking Ahead: Babar’s Test as Captain\n",
      "Despite the media speculation and the growing noise around Babar’s form and leadership, the PCB has made it clear that Babar remains at the helm for the time being. With a challenging series against England on the horizon, followed by a limited-overs tour to Australia, Babar will be keen to prove his critics wrong, both as a batsman and as a captain.\n",
      "His recent struggles with form are well-documented, but Babar Azam’s ability to bounce back has never been in question. Whether it’s on the field or managing unexpected situations off it—like his towel-wrapped prayer moment—Babar has shown resilience and a calm demeanor under pressure.\n",
      "Fan Support Remains Strong\n",
      "While the media and pundits may have their doubts, Babar Azam continues to enjoy immense support from the public. A recent poll, conducted after the wardrobe mishap, asked fans how they felt about the incident. The overwhelming majority found the moment “funny and relatable,” showcasing the enduring goodwill Babar has built over the years.\n",
      "For Pakistan cricket fans, Babar’s ability to handle adversity with grace—whether it’s losing his trousers or navigating a difficult period in his career—is a testament to his strength of character. It’s a quality that has seen him rise to the top of world cricket, and one that will undoubtedly serve him well in the tests that lie ahead. \n",

      "The Indian sports community was rocked by a recent controversy involving Vinesh Phogat and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President PT Usha. The drama unfolded after Phogat, who had been one of India's brightest medal prospects, faced disqualification from the women's 50kg wrestling final at the Paris Olympics. The disqualification, due to exceeding the weight limit by a mere 100 grams, marked a heartbreaking end to her Olympic journey. However, the situation took a darker turn when Phogat accused PT Usha of exploiting her vulnerability for political gain.\n",

      "The Disqualification and Its Aftermath\n",
      "Vinesh Phogat, the first female wrestler from India to reach an Olympic final, had her hopes dashed when she was found overweight and subsequently disqualified. Despite desperate attempts to make weight—including drastic measures like cutting off her hair and enduring sleepless nights—Phogat's efforts were in vain. According to the regulations set by United World Wrestling, all of her previous results were rendered null and void, leaving her without a medal.\n",
      "Following her disqualification, Phogat was taken to a medical facility within the Paris Games village. It was here that PT Usha, who had earlier expressed solidarity with the wrestler, met her. A photograph of this encounter, shared on social media, quickly went viral. However, the image, intended to demonstrate support, became a source of controversy.\n",
      "Phogat's Accusations Against PT Usha\n",
      "In a recent statement, Vinesh Phogat voiced her dissatisfaction with the IOA chief's actions. She alleged that PT Usha had taken a photo with her on the hospital bed without her consent. Phogat criticized the gesture, stating, “You are on a hospital bed, where you don't know what's happening in life outside, you are going through one of the worst phases of your life. At that place, just to show everyone you are standing with me you clicked a photo without telling me and then putting it on social media to say you are standing with me). That's not how you show support. What was it more than (posturing)!” Her comments reflect a deep sense of betrayal and frustration, as she felt the gesture was more about public relations than genuine support.\n",
      "Phogat expressed further disappointment, suggesting that political maneuvering had influenced the situation. “I don't know what support I got there. PT Usha madam visited me at the hospital. One photo was clicked... Like you said, in politics a lot happens behind closed doors. Similarly, politics happened there (in Paris) as well. That's why I was heartbroken. Otherwise a lot of people are saying 'don't leave wrestling'. For what should I continue! There is politics everywhere,” she lamented.\n",
      "Phogat's Political Shift\n",
      "The aftermath of the scandal saw Vinesh Phogat making a dramatic shift in her career. Just a day after the disqualification, she announced her retirement from wrestling. The situation worsened when her appeal for a joint silver medal, filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), was rejected. In a bid to redefine her public image and continue serving the community, Phogat returned to India and joined the Indian National Congress, marking her entry into politics. \n",

It was Sanjay, hovering on the right side of the circle, to lob in a cross pass that was swiftly deflected by Sukhjeet. Indian forwards extended the lead to 2-0 in the following minute with Abhishek dribbling past multiple Japanese defenders to drive it around the goalkeeper to score.\n",

With a 3-0 lead on the board, India was in a comfortable position while Japan tried to shake off the early nerves and bounce back in the game.

      "\n",
      "IndiGo on Wednesday said it has introduced a flight procedure that will enable pilots to navigate the complex terrain surrounding Kathmandu valley with more precision. Aviation regulator DGCA validated the IndiGo flight operated with A320 plane that utilised the Required Navigation Performance with Authorisation Required (RNP AR) approach.\n",
      "\"RNP AR technology is specifically engineered for airports situated in geographically challenging and high-altitude regions, such as Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport (KTM),\" IndiGo said in a release.\n",
      "\"With the airport surrounded by the Himalayas, landing in Kathmandu has traditionally been a challenge for pilots, particularly during adverse weather conditions,\" IndiGo said.\n",
      "According to the carrier, the implementation of the RNP AR system will enable aircraft to adhere to predetermined flight paths with remarkable accuracy, effectively mitigating the risks posed by the mountainous landscape.\n",
      "The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said the RNP AR approach offers several advantages, including enhanced safety through greater precision accuracy and a more stabilised approach.\n",
      "It reduces operational inefficiencies, such as the need for multiple step-downs in non-precision approaches, and lowers the landing minima, the regulator added.\n",
      "Also, the approach will help in having lower fuel burn, reduced carbon footprint as well as financial savings through minimised crew and flight time losses.\n",
      "For RNP AR approaches, pilots have to undergo specialised simulator training and the aircraft must be properly equipped and capable of executing this advanced approach.\n",
