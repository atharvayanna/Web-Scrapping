Agitating junior doctors in West Bengal have written to President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting their intervention in the RG Kar hospital impasse.
Copies of the four-page letter written by the West Bengal Junior Doctors' Front were also sent to Vice President Jagdeep Dhankar and Union Health Minister JP Nadda.
A post-graduate trainee was raped and murdered in state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9. Junior doctors have been on 'cease work' since then.
"We humbly place the issues before your esteemed excellency, as the head of state, so that our unfortunate colleague who has been the victim of the most despicable crime shall receive justice, and so that we, the healthcare professionals under the West Bengal Health department, may be able to discharge our duties to the public without fear and apprehension.
"Your intervention in these trying times will act as a beacon of light to us all, showing us the way ahead out of the darkness that surrounds us," they wrote.
One of the agitating doctors, Aniket Mahato, told PTI that the letter was drafted earlier this month and sent on Thursday night.

New Delhi: Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Friday slammed the government over a video in which a restaurant chain owner is purportedly "apologising" to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for voicing concerns about GST, and said that when "fragile egos" of those in power are hurt, it seems humiliation is what they will deliver. 
Two videos were being shared by several Congress leaders and in one of them at an event on September 11, Annapoorna chain of restaurants owner Srinivasan is seen purportedly highlighting concerns over varying GST rates. In the second video, Srinivasan was seen purportedly apologising in person to the Finance Minister. 
Gandhi said if this "arrogant government" would listen to the people they would understand that a simplified GST would solve the problems of lakhs of businesses. 
In a post on X, Gandhi said when the owner of a small business, like Annapoorna restaurant in Coimbatore, asks public servants for a simplified GST regime, his request is met with "arrogance and outright disrespect". 
"Yet, when a billionaire friend seeks to bend the rules, change the laws, or acquire national assets, Modi Ji rolls out the red carpet," he alleged. 
"Our small business owners have already endured the blows of demonetisation, an inaccessible banking system, tax extortion and a disastrous GST. The last thing they deserve is further humiliation," Gandhi said. 
But when the fragile egos of those in power are hurt, it seems humiliation is exactly what they will deliver, the former Congress chief said. 
He said MSMEs have been asking for relief for years. 
"If this arrogant government would listen to the people they would understand that a simplified GST with a single tax rate would solve the problems of lakhs of businesses," Gandhi said.

Mumbai: Workers and leaders of Maharashtra BJP on Friday held state-wide protests against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his remarks on reservation during his visit to the US. 
While Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekhar Bawankule said it was necessary to stage a protest to tell people about Gandhi's mentality against reservation, Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat accused the saffron party of spreading fake news and doing "nautanki" (drama). 
Gandhi, who is in the US, told students of Georgetown University that the Congress would think of scrapping reservations when “India is a fair place”, which he said is not the case right now. 
During a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington, the Leader of Opposition alleged that democracy in India for the last 10 years was broken, but now it is fighting back. 
The BJP announced a state-wide protest over Gandhi's "anti-reservation" remarks. 
In Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Maharashtra Housing Minister Atul Save staged a demonstration with party workers, carrying placards and raising slogans against Gandhi. 
During the protest in Mumbai, BJP's Dahisar MLA Manisha Chowdhary claimed the Congress has been opposing reservations from the days of late Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to Rahul Gandhi. 
Gandhi's "anti-reservation" stand is exposed, she said. 
Slamming the BJP for staging protests, Thorat accused the party of spreading fake news and doing "nautanki" (drama). 
He further pointed out that Gandhi, in his remarks, never said reservations would be done away with. 
"What are BJP leaders protesting for? They don't even feel the need to verify information. But people will not be swayed by their fake narrative. People know that it is the BJP that is anti-Constitution and anti-reservation," Thorat wrote in a post on X.

Morne Morkel: The New Face of India’s Bowling Department
Morne Morkel’s arrival marks a new chapter for Team India. Appointed in August, Morkel steps into the role previously held by Paras Mhambrey. His appointment is seen as a strategic move to enhance India’s fast bowling unit, which is crucial for the demanding Test season ahead. Morkel, with a formidable record of 544 international wickets across formats, brings a wealth of experience to the team.
Morkel’s illustrious career includes 86 Test matches, 117 ODIs, and 44 T20Is for South Africa, where his impressive statistics and contributions have earned him global recognition. His role will be pivotal in strengthening India's pace attack as the team prepares for a busy season that includes series against Bangladesh, New Zealand, and Australia.
A Fresh Start with Familiar Faces
The addition of Morkel is not the only change for Team India. Head coach Gautam Gambhir, who previously worked with Morkel during their tenure with the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), will reunite with him. Gambhir’s leadership and Morkel’s bowling expertise are expected to bring a fresh dynamic to the Indian team’s approach.
The BCCI’s announcement of Gambhir’s support staff, including assistant coaches Abhishek Nayar and Ryan Ten Doeschate and fielding coach T Dilip, sets the stage for a well-rounded coaching team. T Dilip, retained from the 2024 T20 World Cup, will continue to play a crucial role in the team’s fielding strategy.
Team India Gears Up for the Bangladesh Series
With the Test series against Bangladesh around the corner, Team India has been preparing rigorously. The squad, led by Rohit Sharma, includes notable returns such as Virat Kohli, who is back after a hiatus following the birth of his child. Kohli's return is eagerly anticipated, especially after a challenging T20 World Cup and an underwhelming ODI series in Sri Lanka.
The inclusion of new faces like Akash Deep and Yash Dayal in the pace lineup adds depth and potential to the team. Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant’s return to Test cricket, following his recovery from a life-threatening accident, is a significant boost for the side. His dynamic presence behind the stumps will be crucial.
The spin department remains a stronghold with experienced players like Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, and Kuldeep Yadav ready to provide both balance and impact. The fast bowling unit, comprising Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, and the promising Yash Dayal, will be crucial in tackling Bangladesh’s batting lineup.
Bangladesh's Challenge: Aiming to Build on Recent Success
Bangladesh arrives in India with renewed confidence, having achieved a historic 2-0 Test series win against Pakistan. Led by Najmul Hossain Shanto, the team will look to extend their success against a formidable Indian side. The absence of pacer Shoriful Islam due to injury has opened opportunities for Taskin Ahmed, Nahid Rana, Hasan Mahmud, and Khaled Ahmed to step up.
The two-match series presents a significant challenge for both teams. India, with their new coaching staff and a mix of seasoned and fresh talent, will aim to start strong and build momentum for the upcoming fixtures against New Zealand and Australia.

In the wake of India’s triumphant T20 World Cup 2024 campaign in the West Indies, the cricketing world has been abuzz with speculation about who will step into the formidable shoes of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Both legends have announced their retirement from the T20 format, leaving a significant void in Indian cricket. During a recent podcast, veteran leg-spinner Piyush Chawla shared his insights on the potential successors, pinpointing Shubman Gill and Ruturaj Gaikwad as the future stars of Indian cricket.

Piyush Chawla’s Bold Predictions
In an engaging conversation with Shubhanker Mishra, Chawla didn’t mince words when it came to naming his picks for Kohli and Sharma’s successors. Without hesitation, Chawla endorsed Shubman Gill as a prime candidate to fill the void left by the departing stars. "Shubman Gill is at the top of my list," Chawla asserted. "His technique is impeccable. When a batter experiences a rough patch, it's their technique that often helps them get back on track. Gill’s technique is robust and reliable, making him an ideal successor."
Chawla’s admiration for Gill extends beyond mere technique. He believes that Gill's ability to adapt and perform across different formats of the game showcases his potential to become a stalwart for Indian cricket. At just 25, Gill has already made a significant impact, accumulating impressive runs across formats: 1492 runs in Test cricket, 2338 in ODIs, and 578 in T20Is.
Ruturaj Gaikwad: The Rising Star
Chawla’s second pick, Ruturaj Gaikwad, has also caught the veteran's eye. Despite having played fewer games compared to Gill, Gaikwad’s performances have been noteworthy. “Ruturaj Gaikwad is another special player,” Chawla stated. “He may have faced some setbacks, like being dropped or injured, but whenever given a chance, he has shown a distinct flair. His performances, especially in T20Is where he has scored 633 runs, have been commendable.”
Gaikwad’s journey, though shorter, has been marked by promise. In six ODIs and 23 T20Is, Gaikwad has demonstrated his capability with a combined total of 748 runs. His consistency and ability to seize opportunities have made him a valuable asset to the team.
The Legacy of Kohli and Sharma
The retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma from T20 cricket signal the end of an era for Indian cricket. Both players have been instrumental in shaping the team’s success over the years, with Kohli’s record-breaking innings and Sharma’s dynamic leadership. Their departure from the T20 format opens up new opportunities for the next generation of players to rise to the occasion.
Kohli, who has been a prolific run-scorer and a source of inspiration, leaves behind a legacy that will be hard to match. Sharma’s leadership and explosive batting have also set high standards for the team. As Indian cricket transitions into this new phase, the contributions of Gill and Gaikwad could be pivotal in maintaining the team’s competitive edge.

Family Reunion Amidst Festivities
Hardik Pandya’s Ganesh Chaturthi celebration was notably marked by the return of his son Agastya, who, along with his mother Natasa Stankovic, returned to India earlier this month after spending time in Serbia. The joy of the reunion was evident as Hardik shared a touching Instagram story on September 12, featuring Agastya seated near Lord Ganesh's idol, capturing the essence of the festive spirit.
The Pandya family’s festive preparations were also highlighted by Hardik’s brother, Krunal Pandya, who shared a video documenting the arrival of Ganpati Bappa at their residence. The video provided a glimpse into the family's elaborate Ganeshotsav celebrations, showcasing their enthusiasm and devotion.
Personal Milestones and Changes
Hardik Pandya and Natasa Stankovic’s journey has been one of public interest, marked by their marriage on May 31, 2020, and the birth of their son Agastya on July 30 of the same year. The couple renewed their wedding vows on February 14, 2023, celebrating their bond amidst the spotlight.
However, their journey has also faced challenges. Earlier this year, in July, the couple announced their separation through a joint statement. The statement confirmed their mutual decision to part ways while continuing to co-parent Agastya, demonstrating their commitment to their son's well-being despite personal differences.
Hardik Pandya’s Cricketing Endeavors
While Hardik Pandya has been a dynamic presence in Team India’s limited-overs formats, he has notably avoided red-ball cricket since 2018 due to injury concerns. The 30-year-old all-rounder, who has played 11 Test matches, scoring 532 runs and taking 17 wickets, has not featured in Test cricket since India’s tour of England in 2018.
Recently, Hardik hinted at a potential return to Test cricket, sharing videos of himself bowling with a red ball. His absence from the ongoing Duleep Trophy 2024 has been a topic of interest, but his upcoming three-match T20I series against Bangladesh, starting October 6 at New Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Stadium in Gwalior, will be his next opportunity to showcase his skills.

In a surprising twist that has sent ripples through the cricketing world, India's star all-rounder Hardik Pandya has reignited speculation about a potential return to Test cricket. The 30-year-old cricketer recently shared a captivating video of himself bowling with a red ball during a training session, sparking intense discussions among fans and experts alike. This intriguing development comes after a six-year hiatus from the longest format of the game, raising questions about his future in Test cricket.

A Glimpse into Hardik Pandya's Training Regimen
The video, posted on Instagram, captures Pandya in full flow as he delivers the red ball with characteristic vigour. The sight of Pandya, known for his explosive performances in limited-overs cricket, engaging in red-ball practice has ignited hopes of his return to Test cricket. Fans are eager to know if this marks the beginning of a new chapter in Pandya’s career, potentially culminating in his reentry into the Test arena.
Pandya's Test Cricket Journey: A Brief Overview
Hardik Pandya last donned the white jersey in September 2018 before undergoing lower back surgery in 2019. This surgery significantly impacted his career, limiting his participation in red-ball cricket. Despite having played only 11 Tests, Pandya's performances in the format were noteworthy, accumulating 523 runs and 17 wickets. His dynamic abilities as an all-rounder were seen as a crucial asset to India's Test team.
Challenges Ahead: Can Pandya Make a Test Comeback?
While Pandya’s recent net session has sparked excitement, several challenges loom large over his potential Test comeback. The primary concern is his lack of recent domestic red-ball experience. Since his surgery, Pandya has not participated in any domestic red-ball matches, making his readiness for Test cricket a topic of debate. The absence from domestic fixtures and his decision to sit out the Duleep Trophy 2024 raises questions about his current form and fitness for the longer format.
The Road to Redemption: What Lies Ahead for Pandya?
To be considered for selection in the Test squad, Pandya must demonstrate his capability in domestic red-ball cricket. According to the regulations set by the BCCI, players are expected to prove their form and fitness through domestic competitions. Pandya’s recent form in limited-overs cricket has been impressive, but Test cricket demands a different level of endurance and consistency.
The Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia presents an ideal opportunity for Pandya to showcase his skills. His potential role as a pace-bowling all-rounder could provide the balance India’s Test side needs. However, whether he will be ready for such a demanding series remains uncertain.
The Bigger Picture: Pandya's Impact and Potential
Hardik Pandya’s explosive style of play and his ability to change the course of a match make him an invaluable asset. His presence in the Test team could provide a significant boost, especially in challenging conditions like those in Australia. His return would not only bolster India’s bowling attack but also add depth to the batting lineup.

Kohli's Grand Return: A Long-Awaited Homecoming
Virat Kohli’s arrival in Chennai is more than just a homecoming; it's a momentous occasion for Indian cricket. His last Test appearance in India was back in March 2023, and his absence from the longest format has only heightened the excitement for his return. Since winning the T20 World Cup in June, Kohli has been largely based in London, with brief returns for a limited-overs series against Sri Lanka. His departure from T20Is and absence from recent Test matches, including the England series earlier this year due to personal reasons, has only added to the mystique and fervor surrounding his comeback.
A Fresh Start for Team India
As Kohli settles into Chennai, the focus of the Indian squad shifts to the upcoming two-match Test series against Bangladesh. This series will mark the beginning of India's home season, and the team’s preparation is already underway. The squad features a mix of seasoned veterans and promising newcomers. Notable returns include Rishabh Pant, making his comeback after a life-threatening accident in December 2022, and KL Rahul, who has been recovering from injuries. Additionally, the Indian team will be bolstered by the presence of veterans like Jasprit Bumrah and the formidable spin quartet of Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, and Kuldeep Yadav.
Bangladesh's Challenge: A Competitive Series Ahead
Bangladesh, led by Najmul Hossain Shanto, is entering the series with confidence after their historic Test victory over Pakistan. The team has made a strategic change by replacing injured pacer Shoriful Islam with uncapped batter Jaker Ali. With both teams poised for a competitive series, fans can expect a thrilling clash of cricketing prowess.
Excitement in the Air: Kohli’s Impact and Team Dynamics
Kohli’s presence is not just a morale booster but also a crucial element in India’s strategy against Bangladesh. With a remarkable average of over 54 against Bangladesh in Test cricket, Kohli’s contribution will be pivotal. The Chennai pitch, known for its spin-friendly conditions, will offer a challenging environment for batsmen, making Kohli’s role even more significant. This Test series also marks the beginning of a new era under coach Gautam Gambhir, who is expected to bring fresh strategies and insights to the team.
The Road Ahead: Busy Cricketing Calendar
The upcoming Test series against Bangladesh is just the start of a packed schedule for India. Following this series, the team will face New Zealand in a three-Test series and then gear up for the much-anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia. With such a busy calendar, Kohli’s return and the team's performance will be under intense scrutiny.

The cricketing world was shaken to its core in March 2022 when news broke of Shane Warne’s sudden death at the age of 52. An Australian icon and one of the greatest spin bowlers in the history of the sport, Warne's passing left fans and fellow cricketers alike mourning the loss of a true legend. Recently, the official cause of death has been revealed, providing clarity on the circumstances surrounding Warne’s untimely demise.

The Official Cause of Death: Coronary Artery Atherosclerosis
According to the death certificate released by Thai authorities, Shane Warne's passing was attributed to "coronary artery atherosclerosis." This condition, often referred to as the build-up of plaque in the heart's arteries, results in the narrowing or complete blockage of these crucial blood vessels. The severe narrowing can ultimately lead to a heart attack, which was the suspected cause of Warne’s death.
Reports indicate that Warne had been experiencing chest pain in the months leading up to his death, a symptom commonly associated with coronary artery disease. Despite his apparent health issues, the news of his passing came as a shock, particularly because he had been in Thailand for what was supposed to be a relaxing three-month break.
Warne’s Final Days: A Tragic End
Warne was found unresponsive in his hotel villa in Thailand, where friends initially attempted to perform CPR before emergency services arrived. Despite their efforts, Warne was pronounced dead upon arrival at a local hospital. The circumstances surrounding his death led to an outpouring of grief from the cricketing community and fans worldwide.
The Will and Estate: A Glimpse into Warne's Legacy
In the wake of his death, details from Shane Warne’s will have been made public, providing insights into his final wishes and the distribution of his estate. Warne’s will, drafted just three months before his death, reveals that 31% of his fortune was allocated to his three children: Jackson, Brooke, and Summer. The remaining estate was divided among his brother, Jason, and his niece and nephew.
Warne’s assets include a $6.5 million home in Portsea, Victoria, a substantial sum in various bank accounts, and an impressive collection of vehicles and belongings. Notably, his son, Jackson, was bequeathed Warne’s high-value vehicles, including a BMW and a Mercedes. However, Warne’s former partner, Simone Callahan, and ex-fiancee, Liz Hurley, were not included in the will.
Shane Warne’s Cricketing Legacy
Shane Warne’s impact on cricket is indelible. With 708 Test wickets to his name, Warne remains the highest wicket-taker among Australian cricketers. His career spanned from 1992 to 2007, during which he achieved iconic status with six Ashes series victories and a World Cup win in 1999. His induction into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2013 and recognition as one of Wisden’s Five Cricketers of the Century underscore his significant contributions to the sport.
After retiring from professional cricket, Warne continued to influence the game as a commentator and broadcaster, sharing his expert insights with fans and maintaining his connection to the sport he loved.

The cricketing world was abuzz with relief and anticipation this week as the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that the much-anticipated Champions Trophy will remain in Pakistan. This decision comes as a significant boost for the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), which had been on tenterhooks over the fate of the tournament due to ongoing political and logistical uncertainties involving India.

PCB's Relief: Champions Trophy to Stay in Pakistan
In a statement that has undoubtedly buoyed the spirits of cricket fans and officials in Pakistan, ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice affirmed that there are currently no plans to relocate the Champions Trophy. “As of now, the Champions Trophy is scheduled to be staged in Pakistan and we have no such plans to move it out of there. We are trying to find a solution but for the time being, we are sticking to the same plans,” Allardice declared at an event in the UAE.
This announcement has been met with palpable relief from the PCB, who have been fervently hoping to showcase the tournament on home soil. The Champions Trophy, an esteemed event in the cricketing calendar, holds significant prestige, and hosting it in Pakistan would be a monumental achievement for the nation’s cricketing fraternity.
The Dilemma: BCCI’s Ambiguous Stance on Tour to Pakistan
The path to this decision, however, has not been without hurdles. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) remains a crucial player in the scenario, with their stance on touring Pakistan being a significant factor. The Indian cricket team has not visited Pakistan since the 2008 Asia Cup, and the strained political ties between the two nations have only added layers of complexity to the situation.
While the BCCI has expressed a desire for the Indian team to participate in the Champions Trophy, the final call rests with the Indian government. As of now, the BCCI has neither confirmed nor denied their participation in the tournament. The board faces a dilemma: either participate in the Champions Trophy under current arrangements or withdraw from the tournament, a decision that could have financial repercussions for both the BCCI and the ICC.
Potential Solutions and Speculations
Given the political and security concerns, some analysts have proposed alternative solutions to facilitate India’s participation. One such suggestion involves the Indian team staying in Amritsar, just a short flight away from Pakistan, for the duration of the tournament. This arrangement would allow the team to participate in matches without being stationed in Pakistan, addressing both security and logistical concerns.
While this remains speculative, it underscores the lengths to which both boards and their respective governments might go to ensure the successful staging of the event. The ICC’s current stance, however, underscores a commitment to holding the tournament in Pakistan, reflecting a recognition of the nation’s efforts to restore international cricketing events to its grounds.

#### **8. [Why Australia Pacer Nathan Bracken Who Once Troubled Virendra Sehwag Left Cricket And Become Accountant?](https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/why-australia-pacer-nathan-bracken-who-once-troubled-virendra-sehwag-left-cricket-and-become-accountant-2792510.html)**

Nathan Bracken, once a towering figure in international cricket, has followed a path quite different from many of his fellow retirees. While many former cricketers found post-retirement solace in television commentary or social media, Bracken took an unexpected turn, transitioning from the world of fast bowling to corporate life as an account manager in Kiar, New South Wales. This pivot surprised many fans who still remember his dominance as one of Australia's finest pacers in the mid-2000s. Bracken’s decision to move into the corporate realm highlights the evolution of athletes beyond the spotlight, but it also sheds light on the challenges he faced, both on and off the field.

The Rise of a Dominant Force in ODI Cricket
At the peak of his career, Nathan Bracken was a bowler feared by many top-tier batsmen. Ranked as the world’s top ODI bowler by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2008, Bracken was known for his deadly accuracy, clever variations, and ability to adapt to different conditions. His left-arm medium-fast deliveries often left even the most seasoned batsmen, including India’s Virender Sehwag, struggling. In fact, cricketing icon Sachin Tendulkar once noted in a 2018 interview that Sehwag often felt uncomfortable facing Bracken, a testament to the bowler's prowess.
A Sudden Exit from the Game
Bracken’s cricket career, however, came to an unexpected halt in 2011 when he announced his retirement. After being bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) for ₹1.3 crore in the 2011 Indian Premier League (IPL) auction, fans were eager to see the Australian pacer ply his trade in the lucrative T20 league. However, Bracken made the surprising decision to withdraw from the IPL and soon after, retire from professional cricket altogether. This move raised eyebrows as many wondered why a bowler of his caliber, still very much in demand, would choose to step away.
Post-Cricket Life: A Legal Battle and Corporate Success
Beyond cricket, Nathan Bracken’s life took another intriguing turn as he engaged in a legal battle with Cricket Australia (CA). In 2012, Bracken filed a lawsuit against CA and three medical professionals, alleging negligence in treating a right knee injury that he sustained in 2007, right before an ODI match against England. He accused the cricketing body of failing to diagnose and properly treat the injury, which he claims ended his career prematurely. The case has seen several developments, with the Supreme Court ordering Bracken to detail the damages he seeks.
While the lawsuit put him at odds with CA, Bracken quietly pursued a career outside of cricket. Today, he works as an account manager in New South Wales, a shift that underscores his ability to reinvent himself away from the field. His role in the corporate world is a significant departure from the limelight of cricket, but Bracken seems content with his new career, offering a fresh perspective on life after professional sports.
Dabble in Politics: A Brief Stint
In 2023, Bracken attempted yet another pivot, trying his luck in the political arena. He stood as a Liberal candidate for The Entrance electorate in New South Wales, further showcasing his diverse interests. Although his bid did not yield the desired result, it highlighted his willingness to explore different avenues and continuously challenge himself in new ways.
The Legacy of Nathan Bracken
Despite his relatively quiet exit from cricket, Nathan Bracken’s legacy remains intact. His ability to outfox batsmen during his prime, his sportsmanship, and his unexpected career decisions continue to fascinate cricket enthusiasts. Although he may no longer be on the field, his presence is still felt through his legal battles and professional transitions.
In a sport where many former players gravitate toward punditry or coaching, Bracken’s path is a reminder that life after cricket can be just as diverse and fulfilling. His journey, from being ranked as the top ODI bowler to standing up against Cricket Australia in court, demonstrates resilience. His new role as an account manager may not carry the same glamour as his days in cricket whites, but it is a testament to his adaptability and determination.

#### **9. [Mohun Bagan, Mumbai To Renew Rivalry As ISL Kicks Off Season With Maidan 'Big Three'](https://zeenews.india.com/other-sports/mohun-bagan-mumbai-to-renew-rivalry-as-isl-kicks-off-season-with-maidan-big-three-2792448.html)**

Last season's finalists Mohun Bagan and Mumbai City FC will renew their rivalry as they kick off the 11th ISL here on Friday, marking the start of a new chapter with Kolkata Maidan's 'Big Three' now competing in India's top-tier football competition.
Mohammedan SC have joined their city rivals and two other century-plus old clubs Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in the Indian Super League this season.
Mohammedan Sporting secured promotion after winning the I-League last season, and the 103-year-old club will be eager to quickly adapt to the demands of top-flight football.
Mohun Bagan were the first to join the ISL, in 2020, following their merger with ATK, forming ATK Mohun Bagan.
Since their entry, the Mariners have been consistent and always seen as title contenders, including last season when they became the league champions by winning the Shield but lost to Mumbai City FC in the final for the ISL Cup.
East Bengal joined the top-tier league soon after Mohun Bagan through a separate consortium. Their entry completed the transition of Kolkata's two most famous clubs from the I-League to the ISL, reigniting the century-old rivalry at the highest level of Indian football.
With the addition of Mohammedan Sporting, the Maidan will now witness the 'Big Three' of Kolkata battling it out in the ISL, adding a new layer of competition and excitement to the league, which is now bigger with 13 teams.
The opener between Mohun Bagan and Mumbai City promises to set the tone for an exhilarating season.
Mohun Bagan and MCFC shared the top honours between them in the last couple of seasons.
Mohun Bagan have strengthened their attack with the signing of Australian all-time A-League top scorer Jamie Maclaren who is dealing with an injury at the moment.
But their defence has been struggling since Indian central defender Anwar Ali's acrimonious transfer to East Bengal, while the duo of Brendan Hamill and Hector Yuste have also parted ways.
The challenge for head coach Jose Molina will be to develop new dynamics.
The Islanders have won the ISL League Shield and ISL Cup twice with all of these triumphs coming in the last four seasons.
Captain Rahul Bheke, midfielder Apuia, midfielder Alberto Noguera and striker Jorge Pereyra Diaz have been the biggest stars to leave the team.
But MCFC have brought in Brandon Fernandes, Jeremy Manzorro, Jon Toral, TP Rehenesh, Nikolaos Karelis, Hitesh Sharma and Sahil Panwar and the key for Petr Kratky would be to combine them well.
The 2024-25 season promises to be more open and competitive, with NorthEast United FC setting the tone with a thrilling victory in the season-opening Durand Cup recently.
Down 0-2 to Mohun Bagan at half time in front of a partisan crowd at the Salt Lake Stadium, the John Abraham-owned team mounted a stunning comeback, levelling the score by the hour mark and then edged out the home favourites 4-3 in a dramatic penalty shootout to win their first ever title a decade after the club's inception.
Juan Pedro Benali's team, which narrowly missed the playoffs last season, will look to build on the Durand Cup success.
The team parted ways with Tomi Juric, their top ISL scorer from last season, who made a notable impact despite limited appearances.
However, they have bolstered their attack by signing Guillermo Fernandez and Aleaddine Ajaraie, who contributed significantly to their Durand Cup triumph.
SHADOW OF ANWAR ALI
=================
The shadow of Anwar Ali's four-month ban and Rs 12.90 crore fine, which has to be borne by the player, his parent club Delhi FC and East Bengal, will loom large on the red-and-gold.
One of the finest Indian defenders, Ali was found guilty of breaching his contract with Mohun Bagan by the Players Status Committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF).
Mohammedan Sporting face a tough season ahead due to the departure of key players Eddie Hernandez and David Lalhansanga.
They have bolstered their squad with Indian talents like Sajad Hussain Parray, Makan Chothe, and Gaurav Bora, along with star signing Cesar Manzoki from the UAE Pro League and Brazilian striker Franca.
Head coach Andrey Chernyshov was retained after the I-League success and the Russian would be expected to weave his magic in the ISL now.
Last season's semifinalists FC Goa will enter with renewed optimism under the leadership of head coach Manolo Marquez, who will juggle his club duties with his national team job.
They recently won the Bandodkar Trophy, where they showed their strength against international teams like Brisbane Roar and Defensa y Justicia.
The Gaurs have retained their core and added strategic reinforcements, positioning themselves as strong contenders.
Chennaiyin FC had an active transfer window, adding young forwards, while Bengaluru FC, in what might be Sunil Chhetri's final season, will also push to challenge for playoff success.
Sergio Lobera's Odisha FC have also made rapid strides, including winning the Super Cup, and the Spaniard would look to add to their solitary title.
The squad gets a significant boost with the addition of Hugo Boumous, who reunites with coach Lobera after their successful collaborations at FC Goa and Mumbai City FC.
Kerala Blasters may struggle due to a weakened squad after the departure of Jeakson Singh (East Bengal) and tactician Ivan Vukomanovic.
All eyes will also be on Indian coach Khalid Jamil at Jamshedpur FC who will look to rebuild after a late-season collapse last time.
Hyderabad FC are the weakest in the tournament and endured financial instability in the build-up to the season. They will face an uphill task.
Match kicks off at 7.30pm.

Defending champions India remained unbeaten in the Asian Champions Trophy as they registered their fourth consecutive victory and defeated South Korea 3-1 at the Moqi Hockey Training Base in Hulunbuir, China, on Thursday. Skipper Harmanpreet Singh (9', 43') scored a brace in India's win, while Araijeet Singh Hundal (8') gave an early lead.
Having already entered the semi-finals, India looked to continue their winning ways against Korea in their penultimate league-stage match. The defending champions showcased this intent very early in the match with a stupendous 8th-minute goal by Araijeet Singh Hundal.
A fierce cross pass by Vivek Sagar Prasad was picked up well by Hundal. He made no mistake from the top of the circle. In the following minute, skipper Harmanpreet scored from a penalty corner to extend India's lead to 2-0. This marked Harmanpreet's 200th international goal.
Korea, who registered a fantastic 3-2 win against China to climb up to second spot in the points table, were not going to let India have it easy. (Neeraj Chopra, Avinash Sable To Compete In Brussels Diamond League 2024)
After shaking off the nerves in the first quarter, Korea bounced back with tactical defence, curbing Indian attackers from keeping the ball in possession. In the last seven minutes of the second quarter, they punished India with interjections and counterattacks, eventually setting up a penalty corner in the 30th minute of the match. Jihun Yang came up with a fine execution to reduce the deficit to 2-1.
The third quarter saw both India and Korea trade an equal number of penalty corners, with each earning four. However, only India could successfully put one in the net, with Harmanpreet coming up with a powerful drag-flick to fetch his team a strong 3-1 lead.
India played the quarter patiently and constructed a compact attack to stay ahead of a tactful Korea. Krishan Pathak held on at the goalpost to keep Korea from scoring.
The final quarter saw India do well as they dominated with ball possession. Though Korea made ambitious attempts to score, Suraj Karkera did well in the goalpost to ensure India didn't concede a goal. India will take on arch-rivals Pakistan in their next encounter.

The Indian sports community was rocked by a recent controversy involving Vinesh Phogat and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President PT Usha. The drama unfolded after Phogat, who had been one of India's brightest medal prospects, faced disqualification from the women's 50kg wrestling final at the Paris Olympics. The disqualification, due to exceeding the weight limit by a mere 100 grams, marked a heartbreaking end to her Olympic journey. However, the situation took a darker turn when Phogat accused PT Usha of exploiting her vulnerability for political gain.
BIG EXPOSE BY VINESH PHOGAT

The Disqualification and Its Aftermath
Vinesh Phogat, the first female wrestler from India to reach an Olympic final, had her hopes dashed when she was found overweight and subsequently disqualified. Despite desperate attempts to make weight—including drastic measures like cutting off her hair and enduring sleepless nights—Phogat's efforts were in vain. According to the regulations set by United World Wrestling, all of her previous results were rendered null and void, leaving her without a medal.
Following her disqualification, Phogat was taken to a medical facility within the Paris Games village. It was here that PT Usha, who had earlier expressed solidarity with the wrestler, met her. A photograph of this encounter, shared on social media, quickly went viral. However, the image, intended to demonstrate support, became a source of controversy.
Phogat's Accusations Against PT Usha
In a recent statement, Vinesh Phogat voiced her dissatisfaction with the IOA chief's actions. She alleged that PT Usha had taken a photo with her on the hospital bed without her consent. Phogat criticized the gesture, stating, “You are on a hospital bed, where you don't know what's happening in life outside, you are going through one of the worst phases of your life. At that place, just to show everyone you are standing with me you clicked a photo without telling me and then putting it on social media to say you are standing with me). That's not how you show support. What was it more than (posturing)!” Her comments reflect a deep sense of betrayal and frustration, as she felt the gesture was more about public relations than genuine support.
Phogat expressed further disappointment, suggesting that political maneuvering had influenced the situation. “I don't know what support I got there. PT Usha madam visited me at the hospital. One photo was clicked... Like you said, in politics a lot happens behind closed doors. Similarly, politics happened there (in Paris) as well. That's why I was heartbroken. Otherwise a lot of people are saying 'don't leave wrestling'. For what should I continue! There is politics everywhere,” she lamented.
Phogat's Political Shift
The aftermath of the scandal saw Vinesh Phogat making a dramatic shift in her career. Just a day after the disqualification, she announced her retirement from wrestling. The situation worsened when her appeal for a joint silver medal, filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), was rejected. In a bid to redefine her public image and continue serving the community, Phogat returned to India and joined the Indian National Congress, marking her entry into politics.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has initiated a comprehensive Special Safety Audit of all Flying Training Organisations (FTOs) across India on Thursday. The audit aims to thoroughly assess the safety standards, operational procedures, and systemic deficiencies within flying training organisations to ensure the highest levels of safety and compliance.
The audit will be conducted in three phases from September to November, 2024, covering a total of 33 FTOs. Phase 1 of the audit will cover 11 FTOs and will be conducted in September 2024. The last such special audit was conducted in 2022. This initiative follows a series of recent training aircraft incidents that have sparked concerns regarding the compliance of the training organisations with respect to the established aviation regulations and safety protocols.
The special audit will scrutinise each FTO's adherence to DGCA's regulatory standards, including aircraft maintenance, airworthiness, and training operations. This safety audit will be focusing on various facets of an FTO's operations, such as training curriculum, flying training imparted to student pilots, and the overall supervision and assessment mechanisms employed by FTOs to ensure that trainees meet the required standards of proficiency before being certified to fly independently.
The audit, among other aspects, will also take a close look at the operational oversight and maintenance protocols of the aircraft used for training purposes to ensure that all training aircraft are maintained to the highest standards, with no compromises on safety.
A special safety audit aims to enforce corrective measures where necessary, enhancing the overall safety and effectiveness of flight training in India. On August 20, a training aircraft in Jamshedpur went missing after it took off from the Sonari airport.
As per information from the officials, search operations had been launched in the Saraikela district after the training aircraft went missing after it took off from the Sonari airport.
The neighbouring district of Purulia in West Bengal had also been informed and search operations were immediately launched by the Jamshedpur administration.

Coastal Road To Bandra-Worli Sea Link Connectivity: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation announced on Wednesday that the northbound vehicles on the Coastal Road can directly enter the Bandra-Worli Sea Link from Friday. BMC officials said that Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and his deputies Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar will inspect the new connection between the Coastal Road and the sea link on Thursday afternoon before it is opened for vehicular traffic the next day.
A senior civic official said that northbound vehicles heading to Bandra from South Mumbai via the Coastal Road can directly enter the sea link between 7 am and 11 pm, while the southbound vehicles will have to take the existing route till both arms of the Coastal Road are connected with the sea link.
The Coastal Road, estimated to cost about Rs 14,000 crore, will provide a direct connection with the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, reducing travel time between south Mumbai and suburbs and improving the overall commuting experience. The Coastal Road is being made operational in phases.
Its southbound arm opened from Worli to Marine Drive on March 11. The northbound carriageway was opened from Marine Drive only till Haji Ali on June 10 followed by the stretch from Haji Ali to Worli on July 11. This will be the fourth such opening on the road.
The Coastal Road now allows motorists to reach from Marine Drive to Worli in less than 15 minutes but in the absence of a direct link with the Bandra Worli Sea Link, traffic piles near the Worli exit during rush hours.
The construction of the ambitious 10.58-km-long project started in October 2018.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath conducted a site inspection of the Noida International Airport, currently under construction in Jewar, on Tuesday as he sought to address issues related to land acquisition for the mega project. He also directed officials to ensure that "no outsiders mislead the villagers" about the land acquisition process.
The chief minister closely examined the ongoing work and issued essential directives to ensure timely completion. After that, he held a comprehensive review meeting with district administration, local authorities, and officials of the company constructing the airport.
The airport, whose foundation stone was laid in November 2021, was initially expected to commence operations by the end of September this year after completion of first phase. However, in June, its developer said the flights can be expected around April 2025.
The first phase of the greenfield airport will be spread over 1,300 hectares while eventually the plan is to cover an area of more than 5,000 hectares in four phases, becoming the largest airport in the country, according to project officials.
"The CM emphasized the importance of maintaining high-quality standards while adhering to the established timeline for the airport's completion. He also instructed that any issues arising during construction should be promptly communicated to the state government for resolution," said an official statement.
"During the meeting, he addressed issues related to land acquisition for the airport. He asked senior district officials and public representatives to speak with villagers who are facing difficulties with land acquisition and to resolve their issues peacefully," the statement said.
He also emphasised that "officials should ensure that no outsiders mislead the villagers about the land acquisition process".
"Additionally, the chief minister suggested that officials use the expertise of the Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) to help with acquiring the land needed for the airport," the statement said.
The CM emphasised the importance of ensuring strong connectivity to the Noida International Airport. He called for the creation of an action plan to complete the work on rail, metro, and other transport facilities that will serve the airport.
"Adityanath stated that these transportation links should be ready by the time the airport is completed, ensuring seamless travel for passengers. Additionally, he highlighted the need for multi-level parking facilities at the airport to avoid any inconvenience for passengers," the statement added.
During the review meeting, Gautam Buddh Nagar MP Mahesh Sharma, UP Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar Singh, District Magistrate Manish Kumar Verma, Industrial Development Minister Nand Gopal Gupta, Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh, and officials of the companies constructing the Noida airport were present.
Airport officials recently said most of the work of the runway is complete.
In the first phase, the airport will have one terminal, one runway, 10 aerobridges and 25 parking stands. Among others, check-in kiosks, self-service bag drops, and e-gates are being tested.
According to officials, the airport is being developed in four phases by the Switzerland-based concessionaire Zurich International Airport AG's special purpose vehicle Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL).
YIAPL CEO Christoph Schnellmann earlier told that there was a large interest from domestic and international carriers for the airport.
Once all four phases are completed, the airport will have a capacity to handle 70 million passengers per year. The concession period for the airport that commenced on October 1, 2021, will run for 40 years.

New Delhi: Japanese auto major Honda on Wednesday said it has started joint research on AI technologies with IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay with plans to develop driver assistance and automated driving technologies applicable in various regions of the world, including India.
The joint research is aimed to further advance Honda CI (Cooperative Intelligence)-- the original Honda AI that enables mutual understanding between machines and people, the company said in a statement.
Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL), a Honda subsidiary in India, will sign a joint research contract with the two IITs. "The IITs are a home to a large number of excellent researchers and engineers, and through the joint research with those institutes, Honda will strive to advance the underlying technologies of CI, with an eye toward the future applications for technologies that reduce traffic collisions and enable automated driving," it said.
With an aim to achieve further advancement of CI, Honda and IITs have set joint research themes such as recognition of the surrounding environment and cultivation of cooperative behaviour, and will conduct research and development while utilising the cutting-edge AI technologies, it added.
Under the partnership, for each research theme, Honda associates and IIT professors will engage with IIT students for planning, designing, developing and testing technologies which work beyond the confines of the laboratory and thereby proceed with the research and development more flexibly and with a high degree of freedom, Honda said.
"This will enable Honda and IITs to work in a more flexible environment with deeper exchange of academic and industry insights," it added.
In addition, as part of this research, Honda with the help of IITs is aiming to conduct verification of driving assistance and automated driving technologies in the suburbs of Delhi and in Mumbai.
Due to numerous variations in the road systems and a large number of road users, India has a complex traffic environment where situations that occur frequently are difficult for AI to predict.
"By conducting technology verification in such a technically challenging environment, Honda and IITs will refine the underlying technologies of CI and strive to apply them to future driver assistance and automated driving technologies in various regions of the world, including India," the statement said.
Honda said it has been actively hiring IIT graduates since 2019, and many of them are now playing key roles in the areas of mobility intelligence, including the research and development of CI.

During the journey, I sang 'Chhathi Maiyya Ki Bitiya,' and it made me feel a deep connection with Bappa.”
