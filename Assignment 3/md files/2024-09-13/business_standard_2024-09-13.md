Ford Motor Company said on Friday it plans to restart its factory in Chennai and use it for exports, marking the automaker's intent to reenter the Indian market after announcing exit in September 2021.
			Ford stopped production at the Maraimalai Nagar factory in August 2022. Kay Hart, president of Ford's international markets group, said the company has submitted a letter of intent to the Tamil Nadu government. Two days ago Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin visited Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, and urged its top management to restart production in his state.
			"I am pleased to share that today (Friday) we are announcing that we have submitted a Letter of Intent (LOI) to the Government of Tamil Nadu in India, outlining Ford’s intention to utilize our Chennai plant for manufacturing for export," Hart said. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp

			“We are grateful for the ongoing support from the Tamil Nadu Government as we explored different options for the Chennai plant,” said Hart. “This step aims to underscore our ongoing commitment to India as we intend to leverage the manufacturing expertise available in Tamil Nadu to serve new global markets.”

In a major victory for the Aam Aadmi Party, its leader and Delhi Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, was granted bail by the Supreme Court on Friday in connection with the ongoing investigation into the alleged Delhi liquor policy scam.
		The court had reserved its verdict on two petitions filed by Kejriwal on September 5. Besides the bail plea, the Aam Aadmi Party chief had also challenged the Delhi High Court order upholding his arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation as "legal."

				Arrest of Kejriwal by CBI was only to frustrate the bail granted in ED case : Supreme Court pic.twitter.com/SpqWtgxSfm
			— AAP (@AamAadmiParty) September 13, 2024
		The court also questioned the timing of Kejriwal's arrest by the CBI and said the agency's aim was to frustrate grant of bail to him in the ED case. Kejriwal was arrested on March 21 by the Enforcement Directorate, which is investigating the case for money laundering charges. The Central Bureau of Investigation is also conducting a parallel probe into the alleged corruption by public servants. The top court had granted Kejriwal interim bail on July 12 in the Enforcement Directorate probe, but he remained lodged in Delhi’s Tihar Jail due to his Central Bureau of Investigation custody.
		Last month, Bharat Rashtra Samithi leader K Kavitha was granted bail in the same case by the Supreme Court. On August 9, senior Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia was also granted bail after serving a jail term of 1.5 years. During Sisodia’s bail hearing, the top court used very strong words over the entire probe procedure, noting that refusal to grant bail cannot be a punishment mechanism. “Bail is the rule, jail is the exception,” the top court had noted.
		Kejriwal had earlier been granted interim bail of 22 days by the apex court on May 10 in view of the Lok Sabha elections in June.
		Following the top court’s latest verdict, the Aam Aadmi Party hailed it as the “victory of truth.” Denying all allegations, the Aam Aadmi Party has said that the case has been fabricated by the “dictatorial” Narendra Modi government to "harass" opposition leaders by "misusing" central probe agencies. With Kejriwal's bail, the Aam Aadmi Party is now expected to focus fully on the upcoming Haryana elections.
		In its charge sheet, the Central Bureau of Investigation alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party benefited from the illicit funds generated through the scam and blamed Kejriwal for it. It had earlier called the Aam Aadmi Party leader the “kingpin” in the case.
		The agency alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party government sought a Rs 100 crore bribe from certain businessmen, referred to as the ‘south group’, in return for tweaking the excise policy framework in their favour. The probe agency claimed that this bribe was used by the Aam Aadmi Party during the Goa Assembly election campaign in 2022. K Kavitha is said to be linked to this ‘south group’.
		The investigation into the case was initiated two months after Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena took office in May 2022. Following the allegations of misconduct, the policy was rolled back in July 2022.

India has a growth potential of at least 7.5 per cent, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Friday at an international forum in Singapore. This projection is slightly above the Reserve Bank of India’s estimate of 7.2 per cent growth for the current financial year, FY25.
		During his address at the Bretton Woods Committee's annual Future of Finance Forum, Das said: “I think India's potential growth today... is about seven-and-a-half-per-cent-plus.” The forum took place in Singapore in collaboration with Swiss bank UBS, the Reserve Bank of India said.

		— ReserveBankOfIndia (@RBI) September 13, 2024
		"This year, we expect at the end of the year to record 7.2 per cent," Das said. In the April-June quarter, India experienced a slower growth rate of 6.7 per cent year-on-year. This was attributed to decreased government spending due to the Lok Sabha elections. The rate fell short of the Reserve Bank of India’s projection of 7.1 per cent.
		Das said that risks around growth forecasts are balanced, supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, with private consumption and investment as key drivers.
		“Inflation has moderated from its peak of 7.8 per cent in April 2022 into the tolerance band of around the target of 4 per cent, but we still have a distance to cover and cannot afford to look the other way,” he added.
		For the current financial year, the Reserve Bank of India has projected inflation to decrease to 4.5 per cent. It also estimated that in the next financial year (FY26), the average inflation rate will ease to 4.1 per cent, assuming normal monsoon and no external or policy shocks.
		Das noted that while services exports have increased, merchandise export growth has fallen short of expectations due to weaker external demand. He also emphasised the progress of fiscal consolidation, a decline in public debt, and improving corporate performance as factors supporting a balanced growth forecast.

The Adani Group issued a statement late on Thursday refuting claims made by New York-based short-seller Hindenburg Research. Hindenburg Research alleged that Swiss authorities had frozen over $310 million in multiple Swiss bank accounts as part of a money laundering and securities forgery investigation dating back to 2021 involving the group.
		"We unequivocally reject and deny the baseless allegations presented. The Adani Group has no involvement in any Swiss court proceedings, nor have any of our company accounts been subject to sequestration by any authority," the company said in a media release.

		— Hindenburg Research (@HindenburgRes) September 12, 2024
		As the dispute between Adani and Hindenburg continued, the US short-seller repeated its assertion that Swiss authorities had frozen the funds in question, citing criminal court documents that allegedly tied the funds to the Adani Group through a probe into money laundering and securities forgery. However, the Adani Group has strongly rejected these allegations as unfounded.
		The Adani Group's response reiterated that its overseas holding structure is transparent, fully disclosed, and adheres to all applicable laws. The company further emphasised that it is not involved in any legal proceedings in Switzerland, clarifying that none of its group companies had been named in any court documents, nor had it received any requests for information from Swiss authorities.
		The group added, "Even in the alleged order, the Swiss court has neither mentioned our group companies, nor have we received any requests for clarification or information from any such authority or regulatory body. We reiterate that our overseas holding structure is transparent, fully disclosed, and compliant with all relevant laws."
		The Adani Group called the allegations "preposterous, irrational, and absurd" and stated that they were part of a coordinated attempt to harm the group's reputation and market value.
		Hindenburg’s claims included details of an alleged frontman for Gautam Adani, who reportedly invested in opaque funds based in the British Virgin Islands, Mauritius, and Bermuda that held primarily Adani stocks. "More than $310 million belonging to an alleged frontman for Gautam Adani (chairman of Adani Group) is sequestered in six Swiss banks. The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland took over the investigation after the case was revealed in the press," Swiss media outlet GothamCity reported.

If you’re planning to study in the United Kingdom as an international student, you’ll need to provide proof of sufficient funds to cover your living expenses for each month of your course, up to nine months, as set by the UK Home Office. The current financial requirements, which were tied to domestic maintenance loans, haven’t been updated since 2020. However, from January 2, 2025, new rules will be in place, according to Home office.
	Students heading to London will need to show they have £1,483 (Rs 1.63 lakh) per month, while those studying outside of London will need £1,136 (Rs 1.25 lakh) per month. This is an increase from the current amounts of £1,334 (Rs 1.47 lakh) for London and £1,023 (Rs 1.23 lakh) for other areas. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
	The government has also indicated that these figures will be regularly updated in line with inflation and changes in domestic loans. This means, for students staying in London for nine months or more, they’ll need to demonstrate a total of £13,348 in savings when applying for their visa.
	Will the hike impact Indian students?
	Not at all, says Ajay Sharma, an immigration consultant and the founder of Abhinav Immigration Services.
	"A person going from India spends, on average, around Rs 25 lakh per annum for a good course or institution. Hence these small changes never impact a student's decision," he says.
	Sharma adds, "The key areas around which a student and their parents decide are the course and institution, possible pathways to work after studying, and student visa acceptance rates in India. For instance, the USA became the top destination this year because its visa acceptance rate was better than Australia's and Canada's."
Why has the UK increased its financial requirements?
	The rising cost of living in the UK, especially in London, is a primary reason for the hike. Inflation has driven up prices across the board, and the UK government has adjusted the financial maintenance requirements to ensure that students have enough funds to support themselves during their studies.
	"Studying in London comes with higher costs, particularly for accommodation and transport, which is why the requirement has gone up to £1,483 per month," according to the Home Office. For students outside of London, although the cost of living is lower, there has still been an increase in the monthly requirement from £1,023 to £1,136, reflecting higher prices across the country.
	University Living, a global student housing marketplace, provides a breakdown of approximate expenses for international students:
Accommodation in London: Rs 80,000 to Rs 2.26 lakh per month
Accommodation in other regions: Rs 96,000 to Rs 1.39 lakh per month
Living expenses: Rs 64,000 to Rs 1.18 lakh per month
Total average monthly living costs: Up to Rs 1.82 lakh
Health insurance (IHS): Rs 52,140 per year
UK student visa: Rs 54,359
Tuition fees: GBP 10,000 to GBP 38,000 (approximately Rs 11 lakh to Rs 42 lakh) per year
	“Student accommodation costs vary significantly, especially between London and other regions. In London, rents range from GBP 750 to GBP 2,100 (Rs 80,000 to Rs 2,26,000), while in other parts of the UK, prices range between GBP 900 to GBP 1,300 (Rs 96,000 to Rs 1,39,000),” says Saurabh Arora, CEO of University Living.
Health insurance, visa costs, and tuition fees
	If you’re heading to the UK, you’ll also need to factor in health insurance. The Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) is mandatory for international students and costs £470 per year. Additionally, a UK student visa costs £490 if applying from outside the UK, with a healthcare surcharge depending on the duration of your stay.
	As for tuition fees, they can vary significantly based on your course. According to data from University Living, international students should expect to pay between £10,000 (Rs 11 lakh) and £38,000 (Rs 42 lakh) per year, with courses like medicine at the higher end of the scale.
	The overall cost of studying in the UK continues to rise, and with the new rules coming into effect from 2025, international students, particularly those from India, will need to be even more prepared financially.

#### **5. [Explained: Why Sebi attached bank and demat accounts of Karvy Stock Broking](https://www.business-standard.com/finance/personal-finance/explained-why-sebi-attached-bank-and-demat-accounts-of-karvy-stock-broking-124091300143_1.html)**

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has taken action against Karvy Stock Broking and its former managing director, Comandur Parthasarathy, to recover outstanding penalties of around Rs 25 crore. . The brokerage firm was found to have misused client securities and funds, leading to substantial losses for investors.
	The orders were passed after the brokerage and its chief failed to pay the penalties imposed on them via an order issued by Sebi on April 28, 2023. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
	Since no amount has been paid by either of them, the regulator said that there was sufficient reason to believe that they may dispose off their securities/instruments in the demant account/accounts, or mutual fund folios, or funds held in the bank accounts. If that occured, the recovery of amount that was due from them would be delayed or obstructed.
	The regulator on Augist 7 sent a notice to Karvy and Parthasarathy  to pay dues within 15 days in a case pertaining to the brokerage firm's misuse of client securities and funds.  In a detailed investigation, SEBI uncovered how Karvy had inappropriately pledged clients' securities to obtain loans for its own purposes. This practice violated various regulatory guidelines and posed a significant risk to investors.
	As a result of its findings, SEBI imposed hefty penalties on both Karvy Stock Broking and its former managing director, Comandur Parthasarathy. The penalties were intended to deter future misconduct and recover the losses incurred by investors.
	To ensure that the penalties are paid, SEBI has attached the brokerage firm's bank accounts, demat accounts, and mutual fund folios. This action aims to prevent Karvy from disposing of its assets and avoid paying the imposed fines.
Key Points:
What this case is all about? 
	In April 2023, Sebi canceled the merchant banking license of Karvy Investor Services for non-compliance with regulations. Sebi found that Karvy Investor Services had no physical infrastructure or employees. 
	On August 7, 2024, Sebi issued notices of demand to Karvy Stock Broking and its former chief. The notices included a penalty of Rs 13 crore, interest, and a recovery cost.

#### **6. [Over 30,000 TCS workers affected by TDS errors; Tax dept sends notices](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/over-30-000-tcs-workers-affected-by-tds-errors-tax-dept-sends-notices-124091300243_1.html)**

TCS has a TDS problem. Numerous employees at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have been issued demand notices by the income tax department due to discrepancies in tax deducted at source (TDS) claims. According to a report from The Times of India, between 30,000 and 40,000 employees received these notices, with the tax demands ranging from Rs 50,000 to over Rs 1 lakh, depending on their seniority within the company. 
		The problem is reportedly believed to have stemmed from a software error that resulted in TDS claims not being properly updated on the income-tax portal. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		These notices, sent out on September 9 under Section 143(1) of the Income Tax Act, indicated that there was no record of the full payments made by employees for the March quarter of FY24. Chartered Accountant Himank Singla also commented on the situation through his post on X, explaining that many TCS employees were receiving tax demands for the assessment year 2024-25 due to incorrect TDS updates on the department’s portal, leading to withheld refunds.
		The notices raised concerns among employees, as they highlighted discrepancies between the TDS claims made by individuals and the data available with the tax department.
		The company has send an internal communication advising employees not to take any action on the demands until further instructions were provided, The Times of India reported. TCS also informed its employees that it had notified the tax authorities and was working toward resolving the issue quickly.
		In a separate internal message, TCS communicated that the tax authorities had provided clarification and that they would be reprocessing the tax returns, after which the TDS information would align with Form 26AS issued by the income tax department and Form 16 Part A issued by TCS.
Business Standard reported in July that TCS saw a net headcount increase of 5,452 employees in the first quarter of FY25, bringing the company’s total workforce to 606,998. This marked the first headcount growth for TCS after three consecutive quarters of decline. In the same quarter, TCS hired 11,000 freshers, with Chief Human Resource Officer Milind Lakkad noting that a portion of these hires were freshers whose onboarding had been delayed from the previous financial year. He further stated that there was no remaining backlog from the previous year and that all new hires moving forward would be fresh recruits offered positions this year.
		TCS was also noted as the first company, following Accenture, to report a net increase in its headcount, with Accenture having added 7,882 employees by the end of the third quarter of FY24, bringing its total workforce to 750,200.

The newly introduced electric vehicle (EV) subsidy scheme, PM E-Drive, will provide a subsidy of Rs 10,000 for each electric 2-wheeler sold until March 2025. This support will be reduced by half in the next financial year. For electric 3-wheelers, the scheme offers a Rs 50,000 subsidy, which will decrease to Rs 25,000 starting in April.
		Union Heavy Industries Minister HD Kumaraswamy shared details of the scheme on Thursday, explaining that it aims to achieve a 10 per cent market share for electric 2-wheelers and a 15 per cent share for electric 3-wheelers by March 2026. The initiative seeks to boost the adoption of EVs and establish essential charging infrastructure to support cleaner transportation options. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		When questioned about the exclusion of electric cars from the scheme, Kumaraswamy said that these vehicles benefit from a lower GST rate of 5 per cent.
		The government has designed the new scheme by addressing the shortcomings of the previous FAME phases, which encountered issues with companies selling predominantly imported vehicles and improperly claiming subsidies intended for domestically produced EVs. Consequently, the government had to take action to recover these misappropriated funds.
		Talking about how the new scheme will ensure adherence to domestic manufacturing standards, heavy industries secretary Kamran Rizvi said, “There will be conformity of production (COP) test conducted every six months.”
		Regarding whether companies that have yet to repay improperly claimed subsidies will be permitted to join the new scheme, Kumaraswamy said, “How can we encourage defaulters who have misused the previous scheme?”
		With a strong emphasis on advancing EVs for public transportation, the scheme allocates nearly 40 per cent of its total budget, amounting to Rs 4,391 crore, specifically for electric buses. This substantial investment underscores the government's commitment to promoting green public transport solutions.

#### **8. [Biden to host final Quad summit of his term in hometown Wilmington](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/biden-to-host-final-quad-summit-of-his-term-in-hometown-wilmington-124091300296_1.html)**

US President Joe Biden is set to host the final Quad summit of his term in his hometown Wilmington, Delaware. The meeting, scheduled for September 21, will feature the leaders of Australia, India, and Japan, highlighting Biden’s personal emphasis on strengthening US alliances in his Indo-Pacific strategy.
		The summit will mark Biden’s fourth in-person gathering with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan, reaffirming the importance of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) in countering China’s growing influence in the region. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		Initially slated to be held in India, the summit was moved to the US to coincide with world leaders travelling to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Biden’s decision to host the event in Wilmington, instead of New York, reflects his personal approach to diplomacy, signalling a deep commitment to maintaining and strengthening US alliances.
		Biden’s administration has emphasised the significance of the Quad since 2021, positioning it as a critical platform for addressing security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. The White House views the Quad as a key response to China's increasing military and economic assertiveness, particularly in the South China Sea. Senior officials indicate that the summit will focus on solidifying cooperation in health, disaster relief, and maritime security — areas where the Quad has made significant inroads.
		A senior administration official previewing the summit told CNN, “The Quad demonstrates that the region values collective action, which has allowed us to promote peace and stability, despite the challenges posed by China.”
		Concrete deliverables from the summit are expected to include a significant initiative in global health and health security, humanitarian collaboration, and further efforts to strengthen the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, an initiative aimed at countering China's aggressive activities in contested maritime regions.
		While the Quad summit comes weeks before the US presidential election, Biden and his counterparts aim to secure the Quad’s future beyond their respective terms. Officials are preparing to ensure that the alliance remains a bipartisan foreign policy priority in the United States. This includes long-term funding from national budgets and securing legislative support for Quad initiatives.
		Despite Biden’s impending departure from office in January, the Quad is expected to endure. The official said, “While the Quad is a cornerstone of President Biden’s Indo-Pacific legacy, it is becoming an institution that will continue to shape the region’s geopolitical landscape.”
		The upcoming summit will also serve as a farewell for Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who is stepping down after opting not to seek re-election. Kishida’s successor, however, is expected to maintain Japan’s full commitment to the Quad.
		Biden’s approach to the Quad has been deeply personal, shaped by his long-standing belief in fostering close relationships with foreign leaders. As he shifts his focus towards foreign policy in his final months in office, Biden is expected to continue his engagement with international counterparts, with planned travel to the G20 Summit in Brazil and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Peru in November.
		His administration is also eyeing potential trips to Germany and Africa, alongside ongoing dialogue with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Tensions with China, particularly concerning US alliances in the Indo-Pacific, remain a central issue as Biden looks to cement his legacy in global diplomacy.
		The upcoming Delaware summit will be the first time Biden hosts world leaders in his hometown since taking office. It follows his hosting of Japanese Prime Minister Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol at Camp David last year, a meeting widely seen as strengthening trilateral cooperation in the region.
		Biden’s decision to host the Quad summit in Wilmington also mirrors historical precedents of US presidents hosting foreign leaders in personal settings, such as George W Bush’s talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at his Texas ranch in 2001, and Barack Obama’s hosting of the Nato summit in his home city of Chicago in 2012.
		Known as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the ‘Quad’ was formed after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami to coordinate disaster relief efforts. The partnership, championed by then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, became dormant for several years due to concerns over China’s reaction. It was revived in 2017 as attitudes towards China’s rising power shifted across the region.
		Though China has labelled the Quad as an ‘Asian Nato’, there is no mutual defence agreement in place among the four countries. Instead, the Quad seeks to deepen economic, diplomatic, and military cooperation. The group’s shared vision for a “free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific” is a direct challenge to China’s regional ambitions.
		While the focus of the September 21 summit will be on strengthening existing partnerships, the leaders will also aim to deliver tangible outcomes across multiple sectors. Health and security initiatives are expected to feature prominently, alongside plans to counter China’s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.
		As the US prepares for a pivotal election in November, world leaders will be watching closely to see whether Biden’s efforts to reinforce alliances in the region will carry over into the next administration, regardless of whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump takes the helm in 2025.
		With Kishida stepping down and Biden potentially in his final weeks as president, this Quad summit could represent a defining moment not only for the Indo-Pacific region but for the global order at large.

#### **9. [UPI users can now send Rs 5 lakh for some transactions: Check details](https://www.business-standard.com/finance/personal-finance/upi-users-can-now-send-rs-5-lakh-for-some-transactions-check-details-124091300283_1.html)**

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has increased transaction limits for tax payments using Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allowing people to transfer Rs 5 lakh in a single transaction starting Sunday.
		“Acquiring entities must ensure that the classification of their merchants within MCC-9311 strictly adheres to the tax payments only....Merchants shall ensure UPI as a payment mode is enabled for the increased limit for the tax payments category,” said NPCI in a circular. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		While announcing its monetary policy statement on August 8, 2024, RBI had announced the enhancement of the limit for tax payments through UPI from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh per transaction.
		Consumers can now make UPI payments of up to Rs 5 lakh per transaction for the following categories: a) tax payments, b) hospital and educational services, and c) IPOs and government securities.
		Two additional enhancements were previously introduced through circulars issued in December 2021 and December 2023.
		NPCI has also introduced a new feature called ‘UPI Circle’ on its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. This feature allows primary UPI account holders to securely delegate payment responsibilities to trusted secondary users.
		For instance, parents can provide their children with limited access to their accounts for managing daily expenses. The RBI anticipates that this will greatly improve the convenience and inclusivity of digital payments across India.
		The RBI's ongoing efforts to improve the UPI framework also include measures to enhance security. For example, a proposed four-hour window for users initiating payments over Rs 2,000 to new recipients will allow for transaction modifications or reversals, adding an additional layer of control for users

India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday at the Konstantinovsky Palace, conveying a message from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding his recent visit to Ukraine. During their meeting, Doval informed Putin that Modi was keen to brief him on his discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
		The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Brics National Security Advisers' conclave in St Petersburg. Brics, the informal grouping that comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, provides a platform for both countries to address bilateral issues on the sidelines of broader discussions.

Top points of meeting between Ajit Doval and President Putin:
		Doval’s visit comes amid India’s efforts to mediate peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Following Prime Minister Modi’s August visit to Kyiv, where he called for direct dialogue to end the conflict, Doval has been actively working to advance these discussions. During his visit, Doval relayed Modi’s message from recent talks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, highlighting India’s commitment to facilitating peace between the two nations.
		“As the prime minister told you during a telephone talk that he was keen to brief you about his visit to Ukraine and his meeting with President Zelenskyy. He (PM Modi) wanted me to come and personally brief you about the talks,” Doval told the Russian President.
		India’s role in mediating peace between Russia and Ukraine was acknowledged by Putin, with India maintaining that the conflict must be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy. At the Eastern Economic Forum, Putin had said that India, along with Brazil and China, could act as potential intermediaries in resolving the Ukraine conflict.
		Putin lauded the strong ‘Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership’ between India and Russia, emphasising the importance of security cooperation. Doval also engaged in extensive discussions with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, covering mutual interests and recent diplomatic efforts concerning Ukraine.
		“Both sides reviewed progress in bilateral cooperation and discussed important issues of mutual interest,” the Indian embassy in Russia said of the talks between Doval and Shoigu.
		During the talks, Putin expressed hope for Modi’s participation in the upcoming Brics summit in Kazan on October 22. Putin proposed a bilateral meeting with the Indian Prime Minister on October 22, during the summit, to review their previous discussions and to discuss future actions.
		“We are waiting for our good friend Modi and best regards to him,” the Russian media quoted Putin as saying. Russia holds the chairmanship of Brics for the year 2024.
		Modi’s recent diplomatic push has raised global hopes of India playing a more active role in mediating peace between Russia and Ukraine, with both sides acknowledging India’s long-standing relationships with both nations.
		During the visit NSA Doval also met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Both agreed to work with “urgency” and “redouble” their efforts to achieve complete disengagement in the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh.
		Earlier, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar mentioned that around 75 per cent of the disengagement issues have been resolved. However, he noted that challenges remain, particularly concerning the escalating militarisation of the border.
		The meeting aimed at finding an early resolution to the ongoing border standoff, emphasizing the importance of peace and tranquility along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Doval stated that respect for the LAC was essential for normalcy in India-China relations, and both countries must abide by past agreements, protocols, and understandings
		The clashes in June 2020 in the Galwan Valley deeply affected the entirety of India-China relations, with both countries continuing negotiations for a full resolution. Both sides, however, acknowledged the significance of India-China relations not just for the two countries, but also for the region and the world.
		The two nations have held 21 rounds of Corps Commander-level talks to resolve the standoff, with recent diplomatic talks emphasizing intensified efforts through diplomatic and military channels.

#### **11. [History in making: SpaceX mission crew complete first commercial spacewalk](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/history-in-making-spacex-mission-crew-complete-first-commercial-spacewalk-124091300631_1.html)**

The crew aboard SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn mission successfully completed the world’s first commercial spacewalk—also known as an extravehicular activity (EVA)—from Dragon at 732.2 km above Earth. A four-person crew of civilians stepped out of their capsule and made history as the first group of non-government astronauts to conduct a spacewalk.
		By venturing further into space than anyone has since the Apollo programme 50 years ago, the crew set another milestone in space travel. After the spacecraft reached the record-high altitude, it was lowered to 458 miles (737 km) at its highest point to initiate the spacewalk. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		Tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman and his crew waited until their capsule was depressurised before opening the hatch. Isaacman was the first one out, aiming to join a small elite group of spacewalkers who, until now, had all represented countries.
		While standing outside the Dragon hatch, Polaris Dawn commander Jared Isaacman, the American billionaire who financed the mission, announced as he looked down on Earth: “SpaceX, back at home we have a lot of work to do, but from here it looks like a perfect world.”
		After about 15 minutes outside, Isaacman was replaced by SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis to go through the same motions. The crew also included Scott Kidd Poteet, a former Air Force Thunderbird pilot, and SpaceX engineer Anna Menon, who remained in their seats to monitor the historic spacewalk. The group of four had undergone intensive training before the trip.
		The crew underwent a “pre-breathe” process, which involves purging the blood of nitrogen to prevent the gas from bubbling—a potentially lethal condition—as they prepared for the spacewalk.
		The spacewalk also tested the new EVA spacesuits that SpaceX developed in just two and a half years, incorporating significant new innovations. The suits were designed to fit and function more like normal clothes, offering greater flexibility compared to the highly restrictive and puffy suits that astronauts have traditionally worn during spacewalks.
		The mission involves the Dragon and the Polaris Dawn spending up to five days in orbit, flying higher than any Dragon mission to date and attempting to reach the highest Earth orbit ever flown.
		After successfully completing the spacewalk, the crew strapped into their seats in the Dragon capsule and connected with their families through Starlink internet. The crew posted a tweet on X (formerly Twitter) that read, “Hello Earth – We are grateful for all the support!”
		The Polaris Dawn mission will remain in orbit for the next few days to conduct multiple scientific experiments. The mission is also testing a new communication system that uses lasers to connect with SpaceX's Starlink satellites, a vast network that provides broadband internet across the world.
		The system "has the opportunity to open up an entirely new communication pathway, not just for Dragon, but for [...] Starships or other satellites or telescopes out there," Isaacman said at a press conference on August 19.
		The mission will be testing a variety of technologies and hardware to be used in future human spaceflights by SpaceX and NASA. The demonstrations aim to help advance human exploration of the cosmos in the future.
		Jancy McPhee, associate chief scientist for human research at NASA, stated, “Each mission, whether the crew is comprised of commercial or NASA astronauts, provides a key opportunity to expand our knowledge about how spaceflight affects human health.”
		“Information gathered from Polaris Dawn will give us critical insights to help NASA plan for deeper space travel to the moon and Mars," she added.

After a heated presidential debate between Republican contender Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on September 10, a surge of conspiracy theories has emerged, predominantly fuelled by Make America Great Again (MAGA) supporters. These theories span from claims that Harris was using hidden earpieces to bizarre allegations of supernatural manipulations.
		Social media has been flooded with increasingly wild theories, all aimed at undermining both Harris and the 1 hour 45-minute debate. One of the most prominent claims suggests that Harris was wearing advanced wireless earphones disguised as pearl earrings during the presidential debate. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		Several MAGA supporters on X (formerly Twitter) have claimed that the Vice President’s fashionable earrings were not just accessories but Nova H1 earphones — promoted as the first and only wireless earphones integrated into a pair of pearl earrings.
		The claims gained momentum after a user posted on Twitter, “Busted! She’s wearing earphone earrings,” accompanied by comparative images of Harris’s earrings and a prototype of the Nova H1 earphones, highlighting their similar appearances.
		Despite these claims, Twitter fact-checkers quickly debunked the theory. A clarification on the viral post revealed that the Nova H1 earphones are still under development and are part of a Kickstarter campaign. It also noted that Harris’s earrings were simply transparent pearls from Tiffany & Co, not advanced technology.
		However, this did not stop the allegations. One user remarked, “This is BIG if true. Of course, she would cheat,” while others said, “No wonder they want the mics muted in between so she can hear the ear mic.”
		Harris’s team had requested open microphones for the debate, contrary to claims that muted mics were part of a hidden scheme. Despite these clarifications, the conspiracy theory persisted, with one Trump supporter admitting, “I’m team Trump, but these are not the same; it doesn’t mean it can’t happen, but they’re not identical.”
		Amid the earphone controversy, a new theory emerged, this time accusing Harris and the debate moderators of participating in “witchcraft”. Lance Wallnau, a notable Trump supporter, posted claims that the debate was swayed by occult-driven “deception, manipulation, and domination”. He alleged that the moderators’ questioning was part of a mystical scheme to ensure Harris's victory, even suggesting that “something supernatural needs to disrupt this counterfeit momentum.”
		In addition to these bizarre claims, some MAGA supporters contended that the debate was skewed in Harris’s favour. They alleged that the moderators had shared questions with her in advance, supporting the notion that the debate was engineered to benefit the Democratic candidate.

			PNB Housing Finance (8 per cent at Rs 1,201.45), Can Fin Homes (5 per cent at Rs 951.45), LIC Housing Finance (4 per cent at Rs 730.55), and Aavas Financiers (4 per cent at Rs 1,878.70), meanwhile, were up in the range of 4 per cent to 8 per cent. In comparison, the BSE Sensex was down 0.04 per cent at 82,929 at 11:25 AM.
			Bajaj Housing Finance is expected to make its stock market debut on Monday, September 16, 2024. The initial public offerings (IPO) of the Bajaj Group company witnessed record-breaking investor demand, with cumulative bids for the Rs 6,560-crore offering exceeding Rs 3.2 trillion. The IPO also attracted almost 9 million applications, surpassing the previous record held by Tata Technologies of 7.35 million, in recent years.
			Bajaj Housing's IPO saw a robust demand across investor segments, with the overall demand exceeding 67 times the shares on offer. The institutional investor portion of the issue was subscribed a staggering 222 times, while high net worth individual portions (of up to Rs 10 lakh and more than Rs 10 lakh) saw subscription of 51 times and 31 times, respectively. Bids from individual investors exceeded Rs 60,000 crore.
			Meanwhile, the significant housing shortage and lower mortgage penetration augurs well for the growth of the affordable housing finance companies (AHFCs) in India.  AHFCs, with a geographically diversified portfolio, deep distribution focus, niche customer segment and granular underwriting model, are attractively positioned to capture the opportunity.

			Further, growing urbanisation and government initiatives such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) aims to make AHFCs easily accessible for middle to lower income segments. The long-term outlook for AHFCs remains positive, supported by a large underserved market, favourable demographics, housing shortage, and government incentives like tax benefits and subsidies.
			The Government's commitment to inclusive growth is demonstrated by the expansion of the PMAY scheme, which includes the provision of 3 crore additional houses in urban and rural areas. This is a substantial stride toward the realization of the government's vision of "Housing for all”, according to analysts.
			As per CRISIL Market Intelligence & Analytics (MI&A) estimates, net interest margins for HFCs stood at 3.2 per cent in fiscal 2024, which is expected to reach 3.3 per cent in fiscal 2025 due to expectation of decline in repo rates in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. During fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, GNPA (90+ DPD) for HFCs is expected to witness a slight decline to 1.3 per cent in fiscal 2025. Further, credit costs are expected to decline 20 bps in fiscal 2025 on account of higher write-offs in the first half of fiscal 2024 translating into an improvement in return on assets in fiscal 2025 at 2.0 per cent.

#### **6. [PVR Inox ready for rerating, says ICICI Securities; ups share target price](https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/pvr-inox-ready-for-rerating-says-icici-securities-ups-share-target-price-124091300498_1.html)**

ICICI Securities on PVR Inox: Buoyed by 'five mega-budget Indian movies', domestic brokerage ICICI Securities expects PVR Inox to post its 'strongest' quarterly show in the October-December quarter (Q3) of the current financial year 2024-25 (FY25). Given this, the brokerage has raised PVR Inox share price target to Rs 2,250 with a 'Buy' rating (maintained).
		"We believe stars are aligning for PVR Inox's rerating as it is likely to benefit from a strong content line-up in Q3FY25, with highly anticipated movie releases such as 'Pushpa 2', 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3' and 'Singham Again' among others. In fact, there are five mega budget movies (regional + Hindi) set to release in the quarter. The timing aligns with major festivities like Diwali and Christmas, offering audiences ample opportunity to visit theatres," ICICI Securities said in its report on September 13. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		According to the analysts, weak content pipeline, which led to a weak performance of the movie exhibition industry over the last year, was one of the key overhangs on the stock.
		However, a strong Box Office show by Hindi movies like 'Jigraa' (starring Alia Bhatt), 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3', 'Singham Again', 'Chaava',  'Sitaare Zameen Par' (starring Aamir Khan), 'Baby John', and 'Deva';  English movies like 'Joker: Folie a Deux', 'Venom', 'Gladiator 2', 'Mufasa: The Lion King', 'The Lord of The Rings'; and  Regional movies like 'Pushpa 2', 'Vettaiyan', 'Kanguva', 'Thandel', and 'Devara: Part 1' will likely resolve investors' concern in the coming months.
		ICICI Securities' new target price on PVR Inox reflects around 41 per cent upside from the stock's Thursday's closing price. Meanwhile, on the bourses, shares of PVR Inox rose 2.7 per cent to Rs 1,642.15 per share in the intraday trade today. By comparison, the BSE Sensex was down 50 points at 11:15 AM.
		After a muted Q1 FY25, the July-September quarter (Q2 FY25) has, so far, witnessed robust growth in collections. Till August 19, the net box office collections (NBOC) stood at Rs 1,189 crore, reaching approximately 66 per cent of Q1 levels.
		"A key shift this quarter is the resurgence of Hindi films, which are driving collections, in contrast to the previous quarter where regional films took the lead. Additionally, English films have posted a solid performance, further contributing to the momentum. These trends bode well for PVR Inox," said analysts at B&K Securities.
		That said, the upcoming releases are expected to generate moderate collections, with no major tentpole movies or blockbusters anticipated until the end of Q2FY25, the brokerage cautioned.
		In the April-June quarter, Cinema exhibitor PVR Inox had reported a wider consolidated net loss of Rs 179 crore as compared to a consolidated net loss of Rs 82 crore in the first quarter of the last fiscal.
		Consolidated revenue from operations, too, slipped to Rs 1,190.7 crore in Q1 FY25 from Rs 1,304.9 crore in the year-ago period. Total expenses, on the contrary, climbed to Rs 1,457.5 crore as compared to Rs 1,437.7 crore in the corresponding period in the last fiscal.
		Apart from a strong content pipeline, ICICI Securities says PVR Inox is 'actively' exploring monetisation of non-core real estate assets. It is in advanced negotiations to monetise two of its assets for an expected inflow Rs 300 - 350 crore within 1–2 months.
		That apart, PVR Inox, ICICI Securities added, is transitioning to a capital-light growth model as it aims to reduce overall capex by 25 per cent in FY25, as compared to FY24.
		It is also being selective towards screen additions, prioritising expansion efforts in the underpenetrated south India market.
		Notably, PVR Inox shut down 85 underperforming screens across 24 cinemas in FY24 – all of which were margin-dilutive. In FY25, the company plans to close an additional 70 non-performing screens to improve operational efficiency.
		"The company is in the process of renegotiating the cinema rentals. For new properties, PVR Inox is opting for variable rental agreements. This should help in reducing the volatility of profits due to seasonal variation through the quarters," ICICI Securities noted.
		According to analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services the management is taking steps to drive higher revenue and to optimise costs, but these are likely to fructify only in the medium-term. 
		"The near-term movie pipeline has improved which should result in some pick-up in collections going ahead. We cut FY25 and FY26 Ebitda estimates by 9 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively, to factor in the Q1 performance," the brokerage had said in its Q1 result review report. It maintained 'Buy' on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,650.

Shares of SpiceJet hit an over seven-month high of Rs 72.25, as they rallied 9 per cent on the BSE in Friday’s intra-day trade. Shares of the airline have surged 15 per cent in the past two days amid heavy volumes on expectation of healthy growth. The stock of the low-cost airline is trading at its highest level since February 7, 2024.
		At 10:25 AM, SpiceJet was trading 7 per cent higher at Rs 70.92, compared to the 0.21 per cent decline in the BSE Sensex.

		On July 23, SpiceJet’s board approved a fundraise of up to Rs 3,000 crore through the issue of equity shares or any other eligible securities to qualified institutional buyers by way of qualified institutional placement (QIP). The airline is in discussions with potential investors, with meetings with them being held in India and abroad.
		According to a PTI report, SpiceJet promoter and Chairman Ajay Singh may offload more than 10 per cent stake in the struggling carrier as a part of the latest funding round that is expected to close by the end of September. The budget carrier--which is grappling with multiple woes, including financial challenges, legal battles and grounding of aircraft--is looking to raise money that will help it meet various obligations, PTI reported, citing sources.
		Meanwhile last week, SpiceJet in an investor presentation, said that the company is positioned for promising growth. It added that the Indian aviation industry is poised for significant growth backed by demand-supply mismatch. 
		SpiceJet sees a substantial increase in fleet count, expected with the ungrounding of its 28 aircraft. The company plans to unground three B737-700s, two B737-700 (BDSF)s, four B737-800s, three B737-900s, three B737-8s and B737-Max, and 13 DHC-8-Q400s. However, the LCC did not disclose when it expects to restart operations with these planes.
		Meanwhile, SpiceJet moved the Supreme Court against the Delhi High Court order that directed the grounding and return of three engines leased from Team France 01 SAS and Sunbird France 02 SAS.
		The division bench of the Delhi High Court had rejected the cash-strapped airline's plea, saying it did not wish to interfere with the single-judge order of the same court and asked the parties to settle the dispute.
		The Supreme Court, on Thursday, said it will consider listing SpiceJet's plea challenging the Delhi High Court verdict which grounded three of its leased aircraft engines, for defaulting on payments to lessors. CLICK HERE FOR FULL REPORT

Lignite-to-power producer NLC India Ltd (NLCIL) will invest around Rs 50,000 crore to ramp up its renewable energy capacity from 1.43 GW to 10.11 GW.
		NLC India Green Energy Limited (NIGEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of NLCIL, is established with special focus on renewable energy generation, an official statement said on Friday. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		"NLCIL aims to achieve a renewable energy (RE) portfolio mix of 50 per cent of its total planned capacity, increasing its RE capacity from 1.43 GW to 10.11 GW.
		"The above plan entails an investment of Rs 50,000 crore (approx) in renewable portfolio, which will support India's RE target and contribute to the broader aim of achieving 'net zero' emissions by 2070," the statement said.
		India is committed to a low-carbon emission path while pursuing its development goals, as pledged at COP 26.
		NIGEL aims to expand its portfolio by participating in competitive bidding and exploring emerging opportunities in the green energy sector. Currently, 2 GW of renewable energy assets are under implementation.
		This expansion will reduce the country's dependence on conventional energy sources, diversify energy generation, and lower coal import.
		Additionally, it will help ensure round-the-clock power supply across the country.
		NLCIL envisages to increase the share of renewable energy from 50 per cent by 2030 to 77 per cent by 2047 in its energy generation portfolio, enabling the company to achieve net zero by 2070.
		With a much changed energy landscape beyond 2030, NLCIL foresees no new thermal power capacity addition.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

The NCLAT on Friday issued a notice to IndusInd International Holdings Ltd (IIHL) over a plea filed by lenders of Reliance Capital seeking interest on the payment for the extended period.
		A three-member bench led by Chairperson Justice Ashok Bhushan directed the Hinduja Group firm, IIHL to file reply within two weeks. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) was hearing the petition from Committee of Creditors (CoC) of RCap.
		The lenders have sought modification in the order passed by the Mumbai Bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which had on July 23, directed IIHL to deposit the equity component of Rs 2,750 crore in the CoC escrow accounts.
		It has requested the appellate tribunal to direct IIHL to "allow interest on the Upfront Cash Amount till August 8, 2024" and also " allow interest on debt component of Upfront Cash Amount from August 8, 2024 till Transfer Date which is the date of payment of Upfront Cash Amount" of Rs 9,660 crore.
		Mauritius-based IIHL emerged as the successful bidder for acquisition of Reliance Capital (RCap).
		NCLT-Mumbai on February 27, 2024, approved IIHL's Rs 9,861-crore resolution plan for the debt-ridden financial firm.
		The lenders have also sought permission for "forfeiture of monies lying in CoC designated account (Rs 2,750 crore) upon the occurrence of an event of default".
		On August 8, NCLT had directed IIHL to transfer Rs 2,750 crore into the accounts of RCap's lenders within 48 hours.
		The lenders had submitted that the amount payable under the Resolution Plan, which is below the liquidation value RCap, was locked in more than a year ago when the plan was put to vote before the CoC. This is the only amount that is payable in the resolution process of the corporate debtor.
		Moreover, RCap has been run as a going concern along with its subsidiaries, which have a significant value.
		"Therefore, any increase in the value of the Corporate Debtor (RCap) and its subsidiaries is solely for the benefit of IIHL, being a successful RA who will be equity holder pursuant to implementation of the resolution plan," it said.
		Even though the NCLAT order allows that cash and cash equivalents of RCap will go to CoC, but since it is not an operating company but a holding
		company, the cash and cash equivalents are not much and do not constitute adequate compensation for the stakeholders, it added.
		"The CoC has suffered huge losses (approx Rs 400 crore), assuming return equivalent at least to the current rate of interest payable on LIC bonds for the Corporate Debtor i.e 16.65 per cent, given that Corporate Debtor is under default. The all-in financing costs/IRR of IIHL is also similar," it said.
		Therefore, the recompense to the CoC should be equivalent at least to the all-in financing costs, otherwise in effect CoC would be funding extension for IIHL at a reduced rate.
		"Currently the cost of extension to IIHL is nil while the CoC is suffering losses," it said.
		In November 2021, the Reserve Bank superseded the board of Reliance Capital on governance issues and payment defaults by the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group company.
		The central bank had appointed Nageswara Rao Y as the administrator, who invited bids in February 2022 to take over the company.
		Reliance Capital had a debt of over Rs 40,000 crore, and four applicants had initially bid with resolution plans. However, the CoC rejected all four plans for lower bid values and a challenge mechanism was initiated in which IIHL and Torrent Investments participated.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Western Carriers IPO Review
Should You Subscribe to the Western Carriers IPO?
Canara Bank Securities – Subscribe for listing gains
		Analysts at Canara Bank Securities are bullish on the Western Carriers IPO and have recommended investors subscribe for listing gains. The brokerage highlighted that the company posted impressive RoE and RoCE figures of 20.17 per cent and 29.23 per cent in FY24, far exceeding its peers, which averaged 15 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively. The company’s RoCE is among the highest in the specialty logistics industry.
		According to Canara Bank Securities, the issue is attractively valued with a P/E ratio of 16.85x and a P/B ratio of 3.4x, compared to industry averages of 40x and 6x, respectively. "Therefore, we recommend subscribing to this issue for listing gains," the brokerage concluded.
Anand Rathi Research Team – Subscribe
		Anand Rathi Research Team is also positive about the public offering of Western Carriers and has assigned a subscribe rating to the IPO. According to the brokerage, at the upper price band, the company is valued at a P/E of 21.8x, with a market cap of Rs 1,753.60 crore post-issue and a return on net worth of 22.4 per cent. "On the valuation front, we believe the company is fairly priced. Thus, we recommend a Subscribe rating to the IPO," said Anand Rathi Research.
BP Wealth - Subscribe for medium to long term
			BP Wealth, in its research report, has recommended investors to subscribe to the Western Carriers IPO with a medium to long-term investment perspective. According to the brokerage report, its commitment to leveraging technological advancements and expanding project logistics capabilities position it well to capitalise on the projected growth in the rail-road multi-modal sector, forecast to reach Rs 4,66,700 crore by FY29. 
			The brokerage highlighted that the current issue is priced at a P/E of 16.8x on the upper band based on FY24 earnings and is relatively lower than its peers.
			'Given its strong financials, strategic initiatives, and positioning to capitalise on the expanding rail-road multi-modal sector, we recommend a 'Subscribe' rating for the issue with a medium to long-term investment perspective,' said the brokerage in its report.
K R Choksey - Subscribe
				Analysts at K R Choksey remain upbeat on the public offering of Western Carriers and recommended a 'Subscribe' rating. According to the brokerage report, the company's strengths lie in its extensive pan-India network, strong client relationships, and alignment with key government initiatives like PM Gati Shakti.
				Analysts believe that, currently valued at an adjusted PE ratio of 22x, which is below the industry average, Western Carriers (India) presents a favourable valuation. Considering its strong growth prospects and strategic positioning, K R Choksey recommended a 'Subscribe' rating for the IPO.
Swastika Investmart - May Subscribe
					Swastika Investmart, in its report, has said that a 'may apply' rating is recommended for long-term investors with a high-risk tolerance. Given the company's financial challenges and limited market interest, the brokerage noted that the company faces a long payment cycle and is exposed to several operational risks. However, it also highlighted that the company has exhibited slow but consistent financial growth with a positive trajectory. According to Swastika Investmart, the IPO's valuation is considered reasonable.

By Chiranjivi Chakraborty
	India’s securities regulator is considering tighter oversight on micro-cap firms going public, including monitoring the use of their funds and imposing stricter due diligence guidelines for merchant bankers, according to a person involved in the discussions.
	  Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
	Mandating a longer track record of profitability and greater scrutiny of financial statements are the other potential steps under review, the person said, asking not be identified as the details are private. This follows incidents of fraud in this segment of the market, they added.
	Even so, the Securities and Exchange Board of India is not inclined to take over the listing approval process for small and medium enterprises from the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. and BSE Ltd., the person said. Some investors have been asking for the regulator’s direct oversight in this process. The discussions are still at a preliminary stage and measures may be revised before an initial draft is presented to the regulator’s primary market advisory panel.
	India’s market for micro-listings has boomed since the pandemic, driven by investor interest in tiny businesses that are seen as having the potential to expand amid accelerating economic growth. Just two weeks ago, a $1.4 million initial public offering by a motorcycle dealership with only two outlets and eight employees was oversubscribed more than 400 times, raising concerns about the quality of the offerings in this niche market.
	The surge in investor appetite for shares of firms with an unproven track record as well as some instances of stock-price manipulation have sprung Indian authorities into action. In August, SEBI asked the BSE to halt the IPO of plywood maker Archit Nuwood Industries Ltd. due to concerns over its financial accounts, the person said. 
	In July, the NSE set a 90 per cent cap on listing gains, while the regulator itself has consistently urged investors to be cautious when investing in SME firms. A discussion paper outlining stricter listing rules for this segment will be released by year-end, Ashwani Bhatia, a SEBI whole-time member, told reporters last month.
	An email sent to the regulator and calls made to its spokesman seeking comment went unanswered.
	“SEBI will be looking to strike the right balance between protecting investors and helping the market grow,” said Narinder Wadhwa, managing director at SKI Capital Services Ltd. “The regulator could consider additional criteria like increasing the lock-in period for anchor investors,” he said.

The United States and Lithuania have expressed concern regarding China's "continued provocative, destabilising and intimidating activities" in the South China Sea. The two nations welcomed Lithuania's efforts to strengthen a robust economic partnership with Taiwan and support Taiwan's meaningful participation in the international fora.
		The joint statement was released following the meeting with US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis in Vilinus on September 12. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		The joint statement released by Campbell and Landsbergis reads, "Deputy Secretary Campbell and Foreign Minister Landsbergis reiterated their continued cooperation to counter the PRC's use of economic coercion, with Deputy Secretary Campbell commending Lithuania's resolve in resisting the unjustified PRC political and economic pressure."
		"Both parties welcomed Lithuania's efforts to strengthen its robust economic partnership with Taiwan and support Taiwan's meaningful participation in international fora. The two sides also expressed concern regarding the PRC's continued provocative, destabilizing, and intimidating activities in the South China Sea," the statement added.
		The leaders of two nations underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and expressed opposition to any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force or coercion.
		According to the joint statement, the two nations looked forward to continuing the effective and constructive US-Lithuania Strategic Dialogue on the Indo-Pacific.
		In the joint statement, the leaders of two nations expressed "unwavering support" for Ukraine against Russia amid the ongoing conflict and spoke about the role that China, North Korea and Iran play in enabling Moscow's aggression in Kyiv by its multi-faceted support for Russia's defence industrial base.
		Gabrielius Landsbergis and Kurt Campbell discussed threats posed by China's "malicious cyber and hybrid activities" to transatlantic security.
		The joint statement reads, "The deepening strategic partnership between Russia and the PRC and their attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order remains a profound concern. They condemned Russia's hostile hybrid attacks against Allies and agreed to work closely to address them."
		Earlier on September 1, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller condemned China's aggressive actions.
		In a post on X, Miller stated, "The United States stands with our Philippine allies and condemns the dangerous and escalatory actions by the PRC against lawful Philippine maritime operations near Sabina Shoal in the South China Sea."
		The US response followed accusations from both China and the Philippines of ships ramming each other. On August 29, 2024, the Philippine Coast Guard reported that a Chinese vessel had "deliberately rammed" one of its ships three times near Sabina Shoal, a feature in the Spratly Islands.
		The ongoing tensions between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea have intensified recently, with both nations accusing each other of provocative actions.
		The conflict centres around conflicting territorial claims, with China asserting dominance over almost the entire sea based on its "nine-dash line," while the Philippines relies on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to justify its exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
		In July 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favour of the Philippines, invalidating China's extensive claims. However, China dismissed the decision and persisted in its activities in the disputed waters.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

China starting next year will raise its retirement age for workers, which is now among the youngest in the world's major economies.
		The extension was considered long overdue in a country facing a shrinking population and an aging work force. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		The policy change will be carried out over 15 years, with the retirement age for men raised to 63 years, and 55 and 58 years for women depending on their jobs. The current retirement age is 60 for men, and 50 for women in blue-collar jobs and 55 for women in white-collar jobs.
		The policy will be implemented starting in January next year, according to the announcement from China's legislature reported by state broadcaster CCTV.
		We have more people coming into the retirement age, and so the pension fund is (facing) high pressure, that's why I think it's now time to act seriously, said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Australia who studies China's population and its ties to the economy.
		The change will take effect progressively based on a person's birthdate.
		For example, a man born in January 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 7 months in August 2032, according to the chart released along with the policy.

Russia's Federal Security Service on Friday accused six British diplomats of spying and said a decision has been made to withdraw their accreditation.
		Russian state TV quoted an official from the security service known as the FSB as saying that they will be expelled. The expulsions come as Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits Washington for talks with President Joe Biden that will include Ukraine's request to use Western-supplied weapons against targets inside Russia.

		Starmer said on his way to the US that Britain does not seek any conflict with Russia.
		Russia started this conflict. Russia illegally invaded Ukraine. Russia could end this conflict straight away, he told reporters.
		Ukraine has the right to self-defense and we've obviously been absolutely fully supportive of Ukraine's right to self-defense we're providing training capability, as you know. But we don't seek any conflict with Russia that's not our intention in the slightest, he said.
		The FSB said it received documents indicating that the diplomats were sent to Russia by a division of the UK Foreign Office whose main task is to inflict a strategic defeat on our country, and that they were involved in intelligence-gathering and subversive activities.
		Russian state TV said in a report that the six diplomats had met with independent media and rights groups that have been declared foreign agents a label the Russian authorities have actively used against organizations and individuals critical of the Kremlin.
		The British Embassy in Moscow did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. There was no immediate comment from Britain's Foreign Office.
		Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said in an online statement that We fully agree with the assessments of the activities of the British so-called diplomats expressed by the Russian FSB. The British Embassy has gone far beyond the limits outlined by the Vienna Conventions." She said the diplomats were carrying out subversive actions aimed at causing harm to our people.
		Explusions of diplomats both Western diplomats working in Russia and Russian diplomats working in Western countries have become increasingly common since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
		Russian news outlet RBC counted last year that Western countries and Japan expelled a total 670 Russian diplomats between the beginning of 2022 and October 2023, while Moscow expelled 346 diplomats in response. According to RBC, it was more than in the previous 20 years combined.
		In May, the UK expelled Russia's defence attache in London, alleging he was an undeclared intelligence officer, and closed several Russian diplomatic properties in Britain that it said were being used for spying.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

		The standards were officially approved on July 26 during a plenary session of the ITU’s Telecommunication Standardisation Sector Study Group 13, which focuses on future networks and emerging technologies.
		This initiative received support from Hu Honglin of the Shanghai Advanced Research Institute (SARI), Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China Telecom. With two decades of experience in communication technology, Hu is a key figure in information-centric networking, the report said.
		As telecommunications evolve from 4G to 5G and now to 6G, establishing standards remains crucial. Industry experts and companies aim to participate in developing these standards to gain an early competitive advantage.
		However, there are still differences in the technical approaches to 6G, as highlighted by Liu Guangyi, CTO of the Wireless Department at China Mobile Research Institute, in a March academic paper, as mentioned by the report.
		Liu observed that operators in Europe and the US, where 5G rollout has been slower, exhibit less enthusiasm for 6G development, whereas East Asian operators, such as China Mobile, Docomo of Japan, and Korea's SKT, are more proactive.
		The new standards address various 6G requirements, including secure content transmission, data updates, and system performance assessment. They outline functionalities for immersive and AI-driven services.
		The report quoted Cui as saying that the added system features, such as rapid calculation capabilities, enhance the handling of incoming information, improve task distribution, and enable self-evaluation and adjustments as needed.
		According to the SARI website, this development will further elevate the institute’s global reputation in information-centric networking and establish a strong foundation for future 6G standards.
		The upcoming sixth generation of wireless technology, will follow 5G and is currently under development. Expected for commercial rollout around 2030, 6G aims to significantly advance wireless technology by offering even higher speeds, reduced latency, and increased bandwidth compared to its predecessor.
		6G is projected to achieve microsecond-level speeds and latency up to 1,000 times lower than that of 5G. This new technology is anticipated to support up to three 160-megahertz (MHz) bandwidth channels. Additionally, 6G will integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. 
		Enhanced security measures will be a key feature of 6G networks, providing strong protection against cyber threats and signal jamming. Moreover, 6G is designed to be more energy-efficient, with the ability to reduce capacity during periods of low demand.

India’s renewable energy sector is on the cusp of a major transformation, as the country races towards its ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070. With this shift, companies are on the lookout for skilled professionals who can drive the transition to sustainable power. The surge in demand for talent spans diverse fields — from engineering to data science.
		Companies like Adani Green Energy, Tata Power Renewable Energy, Vikram Solar, and Gensol Group are intensifying their hiring for positions that span project management, data science, weather analytics, solar manufacturing, operations, and supply chain management, according to The Economic Times. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		Adani Green Energy, for instance, is focusing on recruiting specialists in project execution, operations, and maintenance, the news report mentioned. The Ahmedabad-based firm, which aims to generate 50 GW of renewable energy by 2030, is also scouting for data scientists, weather experts, civil and electrical engineers, and specialists in areas such as business intelligence, digital transformation, supply chain and core operations, the report said.
		The company has committed substantial investments in developing a mix of renewable energy projects, including solar, wind, hybrid solar-wind systems, and hydro-pumped storage.
		India’s power and energy sector experienced a 9 per cent rise in hiring activity during the first half of the financial year FY25, compared to the same period the previous year. This uptick aligns with the country’s overarching goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2070, as highlighted in TeamLease Services’ Employment Outlook Report for H1FY25.
		Meanwhile, the renewable energy sector has experienced a remarkable surge in jobs, with a staggering 23.7 per cent increase in FY24, compared to 8.5 per cent in FY23, according to the report.
		The demand for roles is exceptionally high in Tier-II and -III cities, where most renewable energy projects are located, it stated.
		While positions in operations, maintenance, and technical roles are highly sought, there is a rising demand for solar PV and wind turbine technicians and installers, roofers, production operators, storage operators, and waste management specialists, the report added.
		The report, based on a survey of 1,417 employers across 23 industries, noted that Delhi led in current job opportunities in the sector at 56 per cent, followed by Bengaluru (53 per cent) and Mumbai (52 per cent). Jaipur emerged as a leader in new job locations, with 14 per cent of employers expanding there, while Bengaluru, Chennai, and Vadodara saw 13 per cent growth each. The surge in hiring is attributed to infrastructure development, policy-driven incentives, and the rapid expansion of renewable energy.
		Engineering roles are in especially high demand, with 67 per cent of respondents reporting growth in this area, followed by sales positions at 60 per cent, reflecting the sector’s dual focus on technical advancement and market expansion. Additionally, the rise of the electric vehicle industry, bolstered by increasing competition and premiumisation, is contributing significantly to employment growth, further steering the sector toward a low-carbon future.

#### **2. [India's steel companies look forward to recycle mandate for automakers](https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/boost-to-steel-ecosystem-steel-companies-look-forward-to-recycle-mandate-124091300790_1.html)**

The government is expected to mandate automakers to recycle a specified amount of steel from old vehicles, a move that is expected to boost the steel circular economy and nudge scrap availability.
			Taking off from the draft regulations on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for end-of-life vehicles issued on January 30, the Environment Ministry is expected to issue regulations asking automakers to recycle or recover from FY26 at least 8 per cent of the steel used in vehicles placed in the market in 2005-06. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
			The draft regulations specified 10 per cent but the mandate is likely to be kept at 8 per cent, according to sources. The percentage will be increased gradually and go up to 18 per cent in 2035-36. The regulations set a 30 per cent mandate for 2035-36 but the government is likely to keep it at 18 per cent.
			According to CRISIL, an additional 0.2-0.25 million tonnes (MT) of steel scrap would become available if automakers increase recycling.
			“Although this quantity is modest compared to the overall steel scrap consumption by steel mills, estimated at 29-31 mt for fiscal 2024, it would nonetheless benefit the overall steel ecosystem and contribute to the steel circular economy,” said Sehul Bhatt, director - research at CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics.
			Steel companies believe that as the sector works to reduce its carbon footprint, improved scrap availability will benefit them. India does not have enough steep scrap and imported 11.2 metric tonne in FY24 to meet demand.
			T V Narendran, chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director of Tata Steel, said the mandate for automakers will help formalise the steel scrap market. “Overall, this will have a positive cascading impact and support efforts to lower carbon emissions in the steel industry, thus contributing to a sustainable tomorrow,” he said.
			In steelmaking, scrap is a feed material in electric arc furnaces (EAF) and induction furnaces (IF). In the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF), the process preferred by steel companies but one that is carbon-intensive, increasing the scrap rate potentially reduces emissions.
			As steel companies decarbonise, scrap-based technologies will be crucial for reducing emissions.
			Ranjan Dhar, director and vice-president – sales & marketing at steel producer AM/NS India, said even a marginal improvement in the availability of steel scrap will be a welcome development.
			“Seaborne trade is anticipated to face heightened restrictions globally as the industry increasingly transitions towards low-carbon steel production,” he said.
			“Given the protectionist measures of various countries to retain their scrap for their own steel industry and decarbonisation pathways, scrap availability from imports is likely to be restricted,” said Jayant Acharya, joint managing director and CEO at JSW Steel.
			“Hence, it is imperative for us to set up domestic scrap supply chains faster to enable us to move towards India’s decarbonisation journey,” he said.
			Indians retain their vehicles for long and therefore, Dhar pointed out, to facilitate a change the country must develop a robust recycling ecosystem.
			“In India, automobiles have a longer life cycle compared to other countries. Our income levels are different. As a result, automakers will need to introduce compelling incentives to encourage the return of end-of-life vehicles into the recycling system."
			Steel companies are adding capacity at speed. CRISIL MI&A estimates that large steel players will by 2028 add approximately 50 million tonnes per annum capacity (MTPA), with more than 90 per cent of the addition being BF-based.
			“Most large players with existing EAFs are opting for the BF-BOF route for expansion, which limits the use of scrap. Meanwhile, medium and small players are expected to add around 11-15 mtpa of IF (induction furnace)-based capacity,” said Bhatt.
			In India, IF-based players are the largest consumers of steel scrap.
			Among large companies, about 30 per cent of JSW Steel’s capacity is EAF based. Tata Steel is installing a 0.75 mtpa scrap-based EAF facility in Ludhiana and plans to replicate this model in other cities where scrap is available readily.

Electric two-wheeler buyers can avail a maximum subsidy of up to Rs 10,000 in the first year of the PM E-DRIVE Scheme to be rolled out soon, Union Heavy Industries Minister HD Kumaraswamy said on Thursday.
		Addressing a media briefing, Kumaraswamy said the subsidy under the PM E-DRIVE Scheme for electric two-wheelers has been fixed based on battery power at Rs 5,000 per kilowatt hour but the overall incentive will not exceed Rs 10,000 in the first year. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		In the second year, it will be halved by Rs 2,500 per kilowatt hour, and the overall benefit will not exceed Rs 5,000.
		Addressing the media, Kumaraswamy said e-rickshaw buyers can avail of subsidy benefits of Rs 25,000 in the first year and Rs 12,500 in the second year of the PM E-DRIVE scheme.
		"The per kilowatt subsidy for electric two-wheelers is Rs 5,000 for the first year, and in the second year Rs 2,500, for two years, this benefit will be continued," the minister said.
		He clarified that the maximum benefit per two-wheeler will be capped at Rs 10,000 per vehicle in the first year and reduced to Rs 5,000 in the second year.
		Currently, popular electric scooters from makers like Ola, TVS, Ather Energy, Hero Vida (Hero Motocorp) and Chetak Bajaj have battery capacities ranging from 2.88 kWh to 4kWh in a price range of Rs 90,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh.
		For three-wheelers, including e-rickshaws, Kumaraswamy said, "In the first year, they will get (benefit of Rs 25,000), and in the second year, it will come down to Rs 12,500 per vehicle".
		For the L5 category (cargo three-wheelers), they will get a benefit of Rs 50,000 in the first year, and for the second year, it is Rs 25,000, the minister further informed.
		Under the scheme, an Aadhaar authenticated e-voucher will be issued by the PM E-DRIVE portal, and it has to be duly signed by the buyer and dealer and uploaded on the portal. The buyer would also need to upload a selfie to avail of demand incentives under the scheme.
		To avoid the misuse of government subsidy in the scheme, MHI Secretary Kamran Rizvi said, "We learnt many things from FAME-II. So, every six months there will be a conformity test of production, which will ensure that twice a year everything is tested".
		When asked if the EV manufacturers, who had allegedly flouted FAME II norms, would be debarred from the PM E-DRIVE, Kumaraswamy said, "How we can encourage them? We will take a decision".
		Kumaraswamy informed that subsidies/demand incentives worth Rs 3,679 crore have been provided to incentivise e-2Ws, e-3Ws, e-ambulances, e-trucks and other emerging EVs under the PM E-DRIVE Scheme. The scheme will support 24.79 lakh e-2Ws, 3.16 lakh e-3Ws, and 14,028 e-buses.
		The scheme has allocated Rs 500 crore for the deployment of e-ambulances to promote its use for comfortable patient transport.
		The performance and safety standards of e-ambulances will be formulated in consultation with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and other relevant stakeholders, the minister said.
		Commenting on the targeted level of EV penetration with the new scheme, Rizvi said the government is expecting 10 per cent of new annual sales in electric two-wheelers and 15 per cent of new annual sales in three-wheelers.
		When asked about reasons for leaving out electric passenger vehicles used for commercial purposes under the scheme, Kumaraswamy said they attract only 5 per cent GST at present, unlike 28 per cent plus cess for internal combustion engine vehicles.
		On the PM-eBus Sewa-Payment Security Mechanism (PSM), Rizvi said the government has ensured payments to electric bus operators with 38,000 e-buses with an outlay of over Rs 3,435 crore.
		"If a city has contracted a particular operator to run its buses and the operator does not get timely payment, then we will make payment from PSM. Three months time is allowed (to the state to make the payment). Within three months, the state must give back the money ... then (if the payment is not made) there is a provision that the (state) government's account can be debited by the RBI".
		He said that under the PSM, payments for 12 years will be secured.
		Further, he said only those states will get the PM E-BUS SEVA scheme who have signed this mandate.
		"We are aware of 15 such states as of now," he said.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Carmakers are raining discounts on customers in 2024, and with sales dipping by 4.53 per cent in August, more incentives are being lined up to lure buyers this festive season. While the average discounts across the top 13 players increased by 12 per cent so far in 2024, compared to the entire 2023, the companies are going all out this festive season with discounts starting from Rs 20,000 to up to Rs 3.15 lakh across brands, depending on their demand.
		Companies like Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai Motor, Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra, and Honda Cars are leading from the front in terms of festive sops. Interestingly, in the 2023 festival period, discounts were in the range of Rs 25,000 to over Rs 1,00,000 for various models, which was higher than the 2022 levels by around 40-45 per cent.

		Based on industry data, the average discounts by the top 13 players in 2023 were Rs 34,630, which increased to Rs 38,816 so far in 2024. According to data shared by Jato Dynamics, Toyota and Honda are the two companies that have more than doubled their discounts so far in 2024 (See Chart I). The average discounts by Toyota jumped 140 per cent to Rs 49,914 this year, compared to Rs 20,795 in 2023. Similarly, Honda saw a 120 per cent rise in discounts during the same period from Rs 15,412 to Rs 33,930.
		Among the other companies, Volkswagen saw a 70 per cent, Tata Motors around 64 per cent, Hyundai around 50 per cent, and Mahindra around 29 per cent rise in discounts compared to last year.
		According to industry experts, this festive season is seeing high discounts, following a dip in recent sales, owing to lower rural demand. "We are seeing one of the highest discounts in recent years across companies. October is a crucial month with several festivals coming up. As discounts may differ from dealer to dealer and state to state, it will be difficult to come up with an average," said CS Vigneshwar, who took charge as the 37th president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) on Wednesday.
		Jeep India is seeing one of the highest discounts in the market, going up to around Rs 3,15,000 on the Compass, including a cash discount of around Rs 2,15,000.
		Market leader Maruti Suzuki is offering discounts starting from Rs 15,000 to Rs 1,00,000 till the end of September, across models like Swift, Celerio, Brezza, Alto K10, Eeco, Jimny, Fronx, Baleno, and Ignis. Jimny is seeing one of the highest discounts among Maruti models, ranging up to around Rs 1,00,000. On the other hand, a Hyundai dealer in Chennai said that Hyundai Alcazar is seeing the highest discount in its fold at around Rs 2,00,000, while for Verna it can go up to around Rs 70,000, and around Rs 55,000 for Venue. In addition to this, dealers are also adding insurance discounts and several other sops. "On average, discounts range between Rs 40,000-80,000 across models," the Chennai dealer said.
		For Tata Motors, the discounts start from Rs 30,000 for Tigor, Rs 45,000 for Altroz, Rs 65,000 for Tiago, around Rs 80,000 for Nexon, around Rs 1,60,000 for Harrier, and Rs 1,89,000 for Safari. This week, the Mumbai-based automaker, which is India’s leading electric vehicle (EV) player, slashed prices of several EVs in its portfolio as part of the ‘Festival of Cars’ campaign that is running till October 31. Prices of Nexon EV have been reduced by up to Rs 3 lakh, and Punch EV has discounts of up to Rs 1.2 lakh. Tiago EV prices have been cut by Rs 40,000. In addition to price reductions, Tata.ev is offering six months of free charging at over 5,500 Tata Power charging points across India. Following the cuts, Tata Tiago EV will now start at Rs 7.99 lakh, while the Punch EV will cost Rs 9.99 lakh. The Nexon EV will start at Rs 12.49 lakh, the Tata group firm said in a statement. The company further added that the move would help in 'mainstreaming' electric vehicles in the country and accelerate adoption.
		Ravi Bhatia, president and director, Jato Dynamics, said that the 'pain' of lower demand is likely to continue for some more time, and the industry will emerge healthier. "The car packaging and pricing moved up significantly over the last few years. I think we are witnessing a mild-mid correction. The festival window is short, and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are approaching it from four sides: price correction, incentives, extended financing, scrapping and trade-in, and production adjustment," he said. Bhatia added that the pain is likely to continue for some more time, and the industry will emerge healthier. "We are beginning to see high discounts by all OEMs, and Maruti seems to be still holding back. We have also seen price cuts," he said.
		Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is offering discounts of up to Rs 1.1 lakh on XUV300 (diesel) and up to Rs 97,000 for petrol versions. The Bolero also has discounts of up to Rs 85,000-89,000 or so, while the Thar 4WD has discounts of up to Rs 15,000. Meanwhile, the Scorpio-N, particularly the 2023 models, has discounts ranging from Rs 40,000 to Rs 1,00,000. Although the regular XUV700 does not have any discounts this month, the 2023 models come with lucrative deals, offering discounts between Rs 1,10,000 and Rs 1,50,000 on various variants across the country. Mahindra's electric offering, the XUV400, has significant discounts of up to Rs 2,75,000. A Chennai-based dealer said XUV700 offers are coming from Rs 1,90,000 and for Thar it is around Rs 1,50,000.
		OEM price cuts come amid significant inventory buildup at dealerships. The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) said last week that passenger vehicle inventory levels at the end of August have reached alarming levels, with stock days now stretching to 70-75 days and inventory totalling 780,000 vehicles, valued at a staggering Rs 77,800 crore. The numbers in both volume and value terms are 7 per cent higher than July, indicating that dealers’ requests to car manufacturers to calibrate dispatches have gone unheeded.
		Passenger vehicle (PV) wholesales in July have slipped by 2.5 per cent as OEMs have recalibrated their dispatches to dealers in the wake of high unsold inventory lying at the retailers’ end. This is after growing by 3 per cent in June.

Automobile dealers using demonstration vehicles or demo cars for promoting sales can claim input tax credit (ITC) under the GST law, the CBIC has said.
		However, no ITC would be available if demo cars are used by dealers for their own purpose during the course of the business. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp
		In a circular, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) said authorised dealers are required to maintain demo vehicles at their sales outlet as per dealership norms which are used for providing trial runs and for demonstrating features of the vehicle to the potential buyers.
		These vehicles are purchased by the authorised dealers from the vehicle manufacturers against tax invoices and are typically reflected as capital assets in books of account of the authorized dealers.
		As per dealership norms, these vehicles may be required to be held by the authorized dealers as demo vehicle for certain mandatory period and may, thereafter, be sold by the dealer at a written down value and applicable tax is payable at that point of time.
		"... demo vehicles are used by the authorized dealers to promote further sale of motor vehicles of the similar type and therefore, such vehicles appear to be used in the course or furtherance of business of the authorized dealers. Where such vehicles are capitalized in the books of accounts by the authorized dealer, the said vehicle falls in the definition of 'capital goods'," the CBIC said.
		GST law recognizes that capital goods are used or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of business and hence ITC can be claimed on it subject to other provision of the law, it added.
		However, there may be some cases where motor vehicles for transportation of persons are used by an authorized dealer for purposes other than for making further supply of such motor vehicles, say for transportation of its staff employees/ management etc. In such cases, the same cannot be said to be used for making further supply of such motor vehicles' and therefore, ITC in respect of such motor vehicles would not be available.
		The CBIC circular further said that in cases where the registered person has claimed depreciation on the tax component of the cost of capital goods and plant and machinery under the Income-tax Act, 1961, the ITC on the said tax component shall not be allowed.
		A 28 per cent GST, plus applicable cess, is levied on sale of cars.
		Moore Singhi Executive Director Rajat Mohan said the circular recognizes that the intent of the lawmakers was not only to allow ITC on motor vehicles that are supplied as goods but also to extend this benefit to motor vehicles used for furthering the supply of similar vehicles.
		Demo vehicles, employed by authorized dealers for trial runs and feature demonstrations, serve a pivotal role in aiding potential buyers' decision-making processes. As these demo vehicles directly contribute to promoting the sale of similar vehicles, they can be reasonably classified as being used for the "further supply" of such motor vehicles. Consequently, the ITC on demo vehicles is not subject to blockage under GST law," Mohan said.
		Additionally, the circular carefully addresses various scenarios, including situations where demo vehicles are used solely as marketing tools or by service providers without direct involvement in sales.
		"In such cases, the circular correctly disallows ITC, reflecting the government's intention to ensure that ITC is only available where there is a direct link to taxable supplies. This approach enhances compliance while supporting legitimate business activities.
		"At the same time, the circular emphasizes the need for strict adherence to tax treatment and documentation requirements, including the payment of tax when demo vehicles are eventually sold. This ensures a balanced outcome that facilitates business operations while safeguarding against potential revenue loss," Mohan added.
		KPMG, Indirect Tax Head & Partner, Abhishek Jain said the clarification on demo vehicles would go a long way in reducing tax costs on a critical business expenditure for the automotive sector and also bring to rest the ongoing litigation on the matter.
		"A detailed clarification as this with explicit back up to the issuance not only helps bring to rest the current litigation but also reinforces Government's focus on prioritising doctrine of purposive interpretation and lawmakers intent," Jain added.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
